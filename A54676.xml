         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>NOAH,</hi> a Preacher of the Righteouſneſs of God, and a walker with him therein, gave ſignal Warning a hundred and twenty years together, of the approaching judgment on all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers thereof; <hi>Gen. 6. 3,-9. Mat. 24. 38, 39. 2 Pet. 2. 5.</hi> The neglect of his alarming miniſtry, was ſo univerſal, that the flood came and ſwept them all away, ſave <hi>Noah</hi>'s family of eight perſons. And ſo ſhall alſo the comming of the Son of Man, be; ſay's Chriſt; <hi>Mat. 24. 37,-39.</hi> The like dark midnight-ſtate, ſhall the World be found in, at Chriſt's ſecond coming. People will be generally given up to ſenſuality, ſignified by eating, drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, and ſo will alſo be found ſcoffing at any ſuch thing as Chriſt's coming to reign on Earth. <hi>2 Pet. 3. 3, 4.</hi> But, the Spirit, he will come in, will prove a myſtical Fire, that will burn up and conſume all the higheſt excellencies in the fleſhly, earthly, changeable, corruptible firſt-creation-nature of Man or Angel, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by all the Kingdoms of this World and glory of them; <hi>Mat. 4. 8.</hi> This will be an amazing ſurprize, and cauſe a conſternation in all, concerned therein, beyond and above all conception or language, by the underſtanding or tongue of natural Man or Angel Even, when Chriſt is at the door, ready to come forth, about this terrible work, in righteouſneſs to judg and make war on all firſt-creation vanities, will Men generally, more than ever, contradict and blaſpheme the ſpiritual Watchman's warning thereof, ſo that he, with his Fellows, ſhall be men wonder'd at, reckon'd mad-men, and the contemptibleſt Fools in the whole World, for believing or aſſerting any ſuch thing. Hence, will
<pb facs="tcp:34311:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> that day of the Lord (or the Lord, coming forth, in that judgment-day-light of his all-ſearching, all-diſcovering, all-trying new-creation Spirit) be a general ſurprize to the World, Sea and Land, all inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth and of the Sea, in the but reformed, or in the polluted ſpirit of nature. He will come as a Thief, with his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible light upon them, in their midnight darkneſs, never leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting or more deriding any ſuch doctrine or thing. The temper of the World, before the general deſtruction of it, by Water, is made, by Chriſt himſelf, a repreſenting figure of the deſperately rebellious condition and moſt evil circumstances it will be found in, immediately before the near approaching deſtruction of it, by Fire. <hi>Abel, Enoch,</hi> and others, doubtleſs, though not all recorded, did, in the true new-creation ſpirit of prophecy, warn the people of their day, of their groundleſs ſecurity and ſelf-flattery, as to any approaching judgments. <hi>Enoch,</hi> before that destruction by Water, propheſied the ſecond destruction of it, by Fire, at Chriſt's ſecond coming with the ten thouſands of his Saints; <hi>Jude ver. 14, 15.</hi> His being the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> may ſeem not to be taken notice of, without ſome concerning ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy. It was the judgment of the more enlightned ſort of <hi>Jews,</hi> when in their flouriſh, that the World would ſtand ſix thouſand years, a thouſand years for a day, anſwering the ſix days works of God in the firſt-creation, and then, Chriſt would come in the glory, power and marvellous light of the new-creation, to keep his ſeventh thouſand years Sabbath-day, wherein to proclaim a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee to the World, and ſo, a reſt or ceſſation from all the works of man, in his own, work-a-day, firſt-creation ſpirit, life, or activity. Of the ſaid ſix thouſand years, 5678 are paſt. Whether that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt (ſpeaking of the great tribulation in theſe laſt days, beyond all that ever was, or will be) that for the Elects ſake
<pb facs="tcp:34311:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> thoſe days ſhall be ſhortned, may not import a period of Satan's reign and Man's day in this World, before the ſixth thouſand year be fully expired, is a queſtion, with ſome. But, what leſs can it ſignify? The <hi>Jews</hi> appropriate that perſwaſion, as to this World's continuing ſix thouſand years, more peculiarly to <hi>Elias. Elias</hi> complained; he was left alone, in his ſpiritual teſtimony, as to any aſſociates with him, in the awaken'd exerciſe of the ſame ſpirit; as alſo, that his witneſs was univerſally rejected, and perſon perſecuted by thoſe in power. God's anſwer to him was, he had ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men (in that <hi>Iſrael)</hi> who had not bowed to <hi>Baal,</hi> that is, not wilfully and knowingly (through ſelf-love to their earthly life and ſtate, Satan's dwelling place) rejected and hated the heavenly life of that new-creation ſpirit, that is God's dwelling place, for ever, in which he will dwell amongſt, ſhine upon, and own his true <hi>Sion</hi>-Saints, as his People, and himſelf their God, for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Any, that have come forth in the awaken'd exerciſe of the true new-creation ſpirit of prophecy, grace and prayer, everlaſting righteouſneſs and truth, have experienc'd an almoſt univerſal contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and diſcountenance, as Fools and mad Men. The Apoſtles and primitive goſpel Chriſtians (when clothed with a wonder-working power, under the former rain, or firſt ſhower of the spirit, from Chriſt's aſcended humanity) ſeem to have had the beſt on't, as to this; yet how were even they, yea, the moſt eminent teachers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, hated and diſturbed, contradicted, blaſphemed, and murdered? I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought and in vain, ſays <hi>Eſay,</hi> in my prophetical miniſtry, declaring the righteouſneſs of God, as the only true way of Salvation, to Man. This he concludes, as relating to the next to no ſucceſs, he found, amongſt Men. But, he found the Lord's approbation judgment, and, that his work found acceptance, and he, a reward, there;
<pb facs="tcp:34311:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Eſay.</hi> 49. 4. So <hi>Paul, if our miniſtry</hi> (ſays he of himſelf and fellow-Goſpel teachers) prove (through mens wilful neglect and hatred of it) <hi>a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death unto death; yet are we,</hi> therein <hi>a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt, unto God;</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 15, 16. No big looks, nor ſtout words of contradicting Enemies, ſhould appale or diſcourage God's Commiſſion'd Meſſengers of Truth. How were they mock'd, miſus'd, and deſpiſed, even in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> till there was no Remedy? <hi>2 Chron. 36. 16.</hi> God charg'd Ezekiel to diſcharge his Watchman's Office, in ſpeaking his Words to them, <hi>Whether they would hear,</hi> or obey, or <hi>whether they would forbear,</hi> that is, rebel againſt, and reject them.</p>
            <p>So alſo, does he command <hi>Jeremy</hi> to ariſe and ſpeak his words to them, and <hi>not be diſmaied at their Faces, leſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I confound,</hi> or break <hi>thee in pieces, before them.</hi> Jeremy Propheſied amongſt the, then, only profeſſing People of God in the whole World, and yet had <hi>the whole Land againſt him, the Kings, Princes, Prieſts, and People of</hi> Judah. <hi>But, God made him,</hi> in the ſtrength of his true Spirit of Propheſie, too hard for them all; <hi>a defenced City, an iron Pillar, and brazen Walls, againſt the whole Land;</hi> Jer. 1. 17, 18. Yet notwithſtanding all this fencing and ſteeling him, to bear the ſhock of ſuch an univerſal oppoſition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, we find him (through the wrangling diſtemper of his oppreſſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man, that's the diſputer of this World, in the Saint himſelf) at a ſore loſs, and ready to make very ſtrange Concluſions. <hi>I am in deriſion daily, every one mocks and reproaches me, for ſpeaking the Word of the Lord. Then I ſaid, I'le ſpeak no more in his Name. But his Word in my heart, was as a fire, and I could nor forbear,</hi> or hold from declaring it; <hi>Jer. 20. 7,—9.</hi> When his particular denunciations of deſolating Judgments on <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, the <hi>Jews</hi> diſpers'd and confounded, he was ſtill at the ſame paſs, toſſed up and down from poſt to pillar, under a univerſal contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>As for the word thou haſt ſpoken unto us in the name of the Lord,</hi> ſay the Jews, <hi>we will not hearken unto thee; but, do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever goes forth of our own mouth;</hi> follow the words of our own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; <hi>Jer. 44. 16, 17.</hi> This they conclude upon, come what will. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate reſolutions! <hi>When Johanan the Son of Kareah, and all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the</hi> remaining <hi>Forces</hi> (left by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar)</hi> and <hi>all the Jews, from the leaſt even to the greateſt, had beſought Jeremy, to ſeek the Lord, on their behalf, as to what courſe they ſhould ſteer,
<pb facs="tcp:34311:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> after the murder of Gedaliah,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Babilon</hi> left to be their Governour, <hi>he told them the Lord's meſſage, that if they ſtay'd in their own Land, they ſhould be ſafe; if they went to Egypt,</hi> for which he ſaw their inclination, <hi>the</hi> very <hi>Sword</hi> of Nebuchadnezzar, they cauſeleſly fear'd at home, <hi>ſhould</hi> be ſure to <hi>meet with them, there. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanan the Son of Kareah, and all the proud Men, tell him, he ſpeaks falſly, and that the Lord had not ſent him to ſay; go not into Egypt, to ſojourn there.</hi> So, they, not only, go, but force him and <hi>Baruch</hi> along with them, in flat contradiction to their own meſſage. And when there, we have ſeen how obſtinately they demean themſelves against him, and all his words. All this, have we, <hi>Jer 42. 43. and 44 chapters.</hi> At this rate, are true witneſſes of God, handled all along this World. Chriſt himſelf, had, in a manner, a univerſal contradiction to his whole Goſpel-miniſtry of the ſecond covenant, from the profeſſing <hi>Jews,</hi> with their Teachers, Prieſts, Scribes, Phariſees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the firſt. He came to his own people in the firſt, who received him not, but blaſphem'd and murder'd him, for the doctrine of the ſecond, though exactly conſonant to their own Law and Prophets, rightly underſtood; and ſo, became they no people of God, at all, in firſt, or ſecond. What they had, was taken from them, for rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly refuſing the great and true Salvation, by him, farther diſcovered and offered to them. Chriſt's meek and quiet bearing ſuch univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of myſtical Sinners, to his whole Goſpel-miniſtry, is ſet before his followers, therein, leſt they be quite tired out, and faint in their minds, on like occaſion; <hi>Heb. 12. 3.</hi>

            <head>Concerning the KINGDOM of GOD, to vvhich Chriſt hath had a Right, from Everlaſting; Teſtified by Saints in all Ages; unto the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Poſſeſsion vvhereof, the ſignal ſlaying of the Tvvo Witneſſes, and the raiſing them again, by the angelical Preachers of the everlaſting Goſpel, into an Aſſociation vvith themſelves, vvill be an immediate fore-running and preparatory Diſpenſation.</head>
            <p>THERE is not any Truth more frequently foretold, or poſitively aſſerted in the whole Scripture, than the Second Comming of Chriſt to ſet up his viſible Kingdom, on Earth. On his joyful appearance for this, bleſſed Angels and Saints hopes have, from the beginning, been fixed, as the ſeaſon for ſuch an <hi>Opening the Temple of God in Heaven,</hi> as will render the Divine Inhabitant thereof, viſible on Earth.</p>
            <p>This, by firſt cleerly ſtating and declaring the infinite and abſolute Soveraignty of Gods divine Eſſence, above all: And next unto this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine unity, the high and ſuperlative Prerogative of the firſt, divine and creature-compoſition, in the Mediatour's perſon: Thirdly, the great and peculiar Priviledges of the moſt heavenly Saints: And laſtly, the juſt and immutable Rights and Advantages of bleſſed Angels, and other glorified Saints, above whatever was to be found in the natural, firſt-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtate of either. Hence the whole new-creation ſeed of Chriſt, from a ſubjection to chang and vanity, in their firſt-creation life and clothing, have been ſecretly groaning and panting after that deliverance and freedom, that's to be brought to them, by this ſecond, viſible, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all coming of our Lord Jeſus, from heaven, to Reign on the earth. And this, will they, more impatiently then ever, deſire and long after, toward the end of the encreaſing, unreaſonable Bondage, under Satan's reign and Man's day. This, that the whole Creation groanes after and expects, is the peculiar hope, the certain and wel-grounded perſwaſion of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Saints, whoſe Faith becoms an undoubted <hi>evidence to things not ſeen</hi> to the natural underſtanding; <hi>Rom. 8. 22-25. Heb.</hi> 11. 1. They on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have the <hi>firſt-fruits and earneſt of this</hi> (yet inviſible) Spiritual Life, in

And hence, do they greatly thirſt after the full draughts thereof, in his Kingdom. They are, therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant in Prayer to God (and this, in Obedience to, and agreement with the command and will of Chriſt) for the comming of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as thoſe Spiritual <hi>Watch-Men,</hi> that, in harmony with the Holy Angels, <hi>ceaſe not, Day nor Night, to cry unto God</hi> for the Perſonal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their Spiritual Lord <hi>to make his nevv Jeruſalem, a praiſe in the vvhole Earth; Eſay,</hi> 62. 1, 6, 7. For, this will compleat <hi>the adoption of Sons, by the redemption of their body, and manifeſtation of the Sons of God,</hi> in a viſibility of their ſpiritual life. This will be a <hi>Jubile</hi> to the whole World. How deeply, then, are Angels, Saints, and all Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, to be rightly informed, and have their hope fixed in this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant thing, the comming of their Spiritual King, in his new-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Glory, to reign over them? For, therein will be comprehended all their diſtinct Intereſts and Advantages. <hi>Peter,</hi> by way of Prophecy (ſpeaking of this ſpiritual kingdom) poſitively aſſerts it, not to be of <hi>a Fabulous</hi> or controverſible nature, but grounded on clear Evidence, and undoubted Demonſtration. For, he had the honour of being <hi>an Eye-vvitneſs,</hi> by faith, <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> as from the beginning, living in his root, clothed with Glory and Honour; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16-18. And, ſince his aſcent in our nature, have ſpiritual Saints been waiting for his deſcent, therein. God, by <hi>ſetting him at his right hand, therein, has Endovved him vvith the Povver and Glory of his Fathers Throne,</hi> to ſet up his viſible <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on earth; Jo. 5. 22, 27. Act.</hi> 17. 31. All this ſeems implied in <hi>the voice,</hi> Peter <hi>heard from the excellent glory, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am vvell pleaſed; as having deſcended and finished the vvork given him to do, in our earthly nature, by the</hi> compleat <hi>death there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> as to all changable, firſt-creation life; And <hi>aſcended</hi> into the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting new-creature and divine life of God the Mediatour, his Root and Father; in which, fitted for the viſible rule of his ſpiritual kingdom on earth. For <hi>this</hi> bleſſed thing, <hi>are Saints</hi> [out of, or in the body] all <hi>vvaiting,</hi> as his Members, Servants and bleſſed Retinue, to enter with him into the actual poſſeſſion of this Glorious Kingdom, in the viſibility of their, before, hidden, Spiritual Life, which will be <hi>the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sons of God. The glad tydings of this ſecond comming of Chriſt,</hi> in his ſpiritual glory, to <hi>Reign,</hi> as that of his natural birth, in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, will be, firſt, ſignally given by his angelical Meſſengers, as that which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34311:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> will, moſt certainly, bring <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt</hi> Heavens, through a union of peace with his new Heavens and Earth, or higher and lower ranks of Spiritual Saints, together with undeniable marks of his <hi>good vvill to all Men</hi> in general, that are under his happy government; <hi>Luke.</hi> 2. 14. All men, that have not excluded themſelves by a fixed enmity to this ſpiritual king, ſhall have their Eyes ſo far opened, at, and by his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to ſee and admire his long-ſuffring towards them, and his reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, what, at firſt, they loſt. So will the whole new World joyn in unanimous praiſes to God, through Chriſt, their new-creation King.</p>
            <p>And, if this be ſo, a diſtinct conſidering the ſpiritual nature, as well as certain viſibility of this kingdom, will be requiſite; and this, ſo much the more, as the day of his ſecond comming approaches, and drawes nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. This growes more evident, dayly, from the general decay of all natural and moral goodneſs amongſt men, and the increaſe and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Iniquity, litteral and myſtical, that, as foretold, will accompliſh man's day, and period this World. Through the extream abounding of iniquity, nothing of ſupport or comfort will be left ſpiritual Saints or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men, but a rightly Informed Faith, as to the certain approach of the Lord, in his ſpiritual kingdom. In the ſtedfaſt, wel-grounded hope hereof, are they called on, by Chriſt, to <hi>lift up their Heads, as knovving</hi> his ſecond appearance, and conſequently, <hi>their</hi> full <hi>redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dravvs nigh,</hi> and will ſoon be accompliſhed. For this great and moſt concerning thing and Truth, have we a Cloud of Witneſſes, in Scripture, even for the glorious Comming and Kingdom of our Lord, as alſo an account of the diſtinct hands by which given, divine and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely, or both together. God, in his infinite divine Eſſence; the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, in his conjunctive divine and creature-nature; and the pure creature-ſpirit of Faith, living in a ſucceſſion of ſpiritual Saints, from firſt to laſt, do all agree in their Teſtimony to this Truth. <hi>The Myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2. 2. is all opened by Chriſt the Branch, which <hi>Paul</hi> earneſtly deſires, Saints may <hi>be filled vvith the rich and full aſſurance of.</hi> And, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2, 3. treating of the ſame high and glorious Truths, he layes down the original and fundamental <hi>Ordinances of Truth,</hi> as he received them from Chriſt's own hand. He declares it neceſſary for men to know, <hi>That the Head of every Man is Chriſt; and that the Head of the Woman, is the Man; and the Head of Chriſt, God.</hi> In theſe gradations of a three-fold-Headſhip, he ſumm's up the eſſential Foundations of all Truth, divine and creaturely; to wit, of God, in his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34311:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> divine unity; then, of the Mediatour, in his ſupream, divine and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-compoſition; and then thirdly, of Chriſt, as Son and Branch, the appointed means for rendring the ſaid divine and creature-glories of God the Mediator, viſible to bleſſed Angels and Saints. The higheſt of theſe Ordinances of Truth (though laſt expreſſed) is, <hi>That the Head of Chriſt is God.</hi> God the Mediatour, in his conjunctive, divine and creature-form of God, confeſſes and ownes the ſingle and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded divine Eſſence, as his abſolute Head and Father. This is the firſt and higheſt Ordinance of Truth.</p>
            <p>Next unto this, Chriſt is the head of every man; that is, Chriſt, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, in the firſt and higheſt conjunction of divine and creature-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the immediate Head of himſelf, as the firſt-born Creature and Reſurrection-Lamb, and conſequently, of every Angel and Man, in both creations, natural or ſpiritual. And then, as the third and laſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Truth, is the Man Chriſt as Reſurrection-Lamb, in his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, new-creation Life, Head of the Woman, or Natural-ſtate, in Chriſt's perſon (as brought into ſubjection to the new-creation Man) and alſo, of all his heavenly and earthly glorified Saints and Angels; or Church, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
            <p>There is a like relation of Father and Son, in the Mediatour's creature-nature, Root and Branch, as of the divine Father and Son, in the divine nature. And, ſo is his Creature-nature, throughout, and on all accounts, the ſupream creature-likeneſs of the infinite divinity. 'Tis the abſolute and peculiar Prerogative of the divine nature, not only to be the original of its own Being from Eternity, or to be what it is, without all begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but alſo, of that purely divine Form and Image of it ſelf, in the Mediatour, to whom God, in the ſingle divine Eſence, is Head and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is therefore ſaid, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 5. There is one God,</hi> in the divine Eſſence, uncompounded with any creature-being; and, in diſtinction from God, in this ſupream conſideration, <hi>One Mediatour betvveen God and Men,</hi> mediating between, and therefore conſiſting of two natures, divine and creaturely. <hi>A Mediatour is not of one, but God is one.</hi> To the Mediatour, in this Compoſition, is the ſingle divine Eſſence, Head. And the divine nature, or purely divine form of God, which is one with the divine eſſence, as the immediate former of his own creature-ſpirit, from everlaſting, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22, 23. ſtands in a headſhip or ſuperiority to that creature-ſpirit, which is his own divine workmanſhip, in his own perſon. As the purely divine Son of God, is he under a like impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34311:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> with the Father, of being immediately ſeen or known by any, but the divine Being it ſelf. For, in this divine relation of Father and Son, are they fitted, only, for the fruition of each other. And ſo, the divine Son <hi>lay</hi> ſhut up <hi>in the boſom of the</hi> divine <hi>Father,</hi> till the good will and mind of both was, to build a creature-houſe for themſelves, which was the Root and former of all meer creature-beings, in both Worlds, <hi>Heb. 1. 2. This</hi> original <hi>Word,</hi> or creature-<hi>beginning, vvas in God, and vvith God, and vvas God.</hi> And <hi>by it, vvere all</hi> other <hi>things made; John</hi> 1. 1. 3. The diſtinction of divine and creature-nature in the Mediatour, is intirely preſerved in their perſonal Unity. His creature-nature is called <hi>the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi> His divine is without all beginning. Again, the infinite divine <hi>builder of the</hi> ſupream creature-<hi>houſe</hi> for himſelf, <hi>is above the houſe,</hi> ſo <hi>built by him,</hi> (though taken into perſonal union with the divine Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant thereof) as is implied, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 3, 4. The infinite divinity wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up it ſelf, in a <hi>fellovvſhip</hi> or perſonal union with its own creature-houſe, makes up that wonderful <hi>Myſtery; Epheſ.</hi> 3. 9. The Fellowſhip of divine and creature-nature, was, before all time, <hi>a Myſtery hid in God.</hi> But, in this ſupream divine and creature-fellowſhip, was the certain foundation laid, from everlaſting, for God's revealing his own divinity to Angels and men, when made; which otherwiſe had remained invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and unapproachable to them all, for ever. The divine Spirit, in <hi>Building its ovvn</hi> creature-<hi>houſe, hevv'd out the ſeven Pillars thereof; Prov.</hi> 9. 1. This ſignifies the fulneſs and variety of this creature-building or ſpirit, in the capacity of Root and Branch, Father and Son. And, through the Son and Branch (as admitted into union with the divinity, in the ſame perſonal fellowſhip, with his Root) comes all to be beheld by bleſſed Saints and Angels.</p>
            <p>But, for better underſtanding this whole Miſtery, conſider farther, the relation of Root and Branch, or, Father and Son, in the Mediatours creature-nature, as well as in the divine. This diſtinction was fitly figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, in <hi>the top and foot of Jacob's Ladder,</hi> the divinity of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour ſtanding above, or, on the top of it, as Head thereof. And, <hi>this top of it,</hi> or, creature-root, is Head to its <hi>ovvn foot, the Branch;</hi> and, as fitted by immediate Perſonal union with the divinity, receives the fulnes of that divine Ocean, to which ſo united. But, in this firſt and higheſt Marriage-union of divine and creature-nature, is God, yet, in too great a height, for the creature's immediate ſight or enjoyment of him. The ſcorching Beams of the Mediatour's divinity, are not ſo allayed and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34311:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> in this higheſt union thereof, with his ſupream creature-Spirit, the root of all creation, as that Angels or Men may receive or converſe therewith. This higheſt creature-mount or ſpirit, in the Mediatour, was fitly typed out by that mount, under the Law, that was ſo glorious and dreadful, as to become preſent Death to all that (immediatly) touched the ſame. But, there is a lower capacity in the mediatour's crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-nature, called the <hi>Son and Branch,</hi> which anſwers the creatures <hi>vvish,</hi> in an immediate Head-ſhip, to them. This Son and Branch is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in his inviſible, angelical ſtate, <hi>before the foundation of the World,</hi> and that, both in a pure, but changable firſt-creation ſtate, as the firſt-born therein, and as <hi>the Lamb ſlain,</hi> and ſo, by the death of that mortal ſtate, taken into perſonal union with his creature-root, in new-creation-Life; and through that, with his divinity, alſo. So comes the Son and Branch to be filled with all the fulneſs and life of both. And, the ſame thing did he, in and with our viſible humane nature, <hi>in the fulneſs of time.</hi> He made the like ſacrifice thereof, for the like end. And thus is the ſon and branch, in his reſurrection-life, the bleſſed medium, by which, the viſion of the divine Glory is let down and given to his creatures, which, by the root, or top of his creature-building, ſingly conſidered, was incommunicable to them. By the branch, is it <hi>brought ſo neer,</hi> as, with a meet regard to the dignity of the mediatour, and ſafety of bleſſed creatures, to become fit for the ſight and injoyment of Angels and Saints. The twofold reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection-ſtate, or Heavenly and Glorified earthly Spirit or Life of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted branch, is the miſtical <hi>Golden Pot,</hi> into which the divine <hi>Manna</hi> (the everlaſting Food or Bread of life, to happy Angels and Saints) <hi>is put,</hi> and hath been hid, from before the foundation of the world. This capacity in Chriſt, as branch, is of the ſame Date with his creature-root, <hi>as poſſeſſed thereby, in the beginning of his vvay,</hi> toward's the creation of the world; <hi>Prov. 8, 22. By the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as living in his new-creature root, did all things receive their inviſible exiſtence, and viſible creation. <hi>By him,</hi> ſo conſidered, <hi>vvere all things made, and vvithout him, vvas not any thing made, that vvas made,</hi> or created; <hi>Jo. 1. 3. 1 Col. 15-17. Heb.</hi> 1. 2. Thus, the ſutable medium, by which God condeſcend's to let down himlelf to creatures ſight and enjoyment, was prepared, as the immediate hand, by which they received their creation. In the ſpirit of the branch, as ſtanding up in his root, had Angels and the ſpirits of men their firſt, inviſible exiſtence, and thereby, as their parent, are brought forth into their perſonal ſubſiſtences, by creation. And, in him is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34311:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> up the Bread of everlaſting Life, for their Immortal ſpirits, which they are not capacitated to feed on, in the mortal life of their firſt-creation; but, immortal life, by a ſecond. This never-periſhing food is ſuted only to a never-periſhing Life. Both root and branch, or creature-Father and Son, in the mediatour, had, from everlaſting, not only the enjoyment of each other, but of the divine glory, alſo, in the ſame bleſſed perſon. And ſo, did God moſt high, with delight, behold all his deſigns and purpoſes, finiſhed in him, before any thing was brought forth, by creation. And, in the wonderful fellowſhip of divine and creature-nature, in himſelf, did God the Mediator <hi>reſt</hi> alſo <hi>from</hi> all <hi>his vvorkes,</hi> before any of them were brought forth, as beholding all the contrivances of his divine mind (in the firſt conjunction of his divine nature, with his creature root) thus declared and executed in <hi>the Son and branch.</hi> This branch, alſo, had his peculiar <hi>delight in the</hi> principality or headſhip given him, over Angels and Men (as exiſting in him, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as <hi>the habitable parts of his Earth) before the foundation of the World; Prov.</hi> 8. 30, 31. He rejoyced alwayes, before his father, not only as enjoying the viſion of the divine glory, but, as the ſame was in him trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up; and by him, communicable to them.</p>
            <p>And, thus ſee we the need of root and branch, in the mediatour's creature-nature, as the aſcent and deſcent of his great creature-building. By the former, is he qualified to receive the divine viſion, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Ocean-fulnes thereof: by the latter, to conveigh and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it, to his bleſſed Angels and Saints. In the creature-root, or top of his creature-houſe, is his divinity ſhut up from his creatures, till reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or opened by the branch. The branch is the myſtical Door of this great creature-building, and alſo opener thereof, to his creatures. <hi>David,</hi> by faith, ſaw and heard the great Lord the Mediatour, in his higheſt and firſt Union of divine and creature-nature, ſpeaking to Chriſt the branch, as <hi>David</hi>'s immediate Lord and Head, ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right Hand, until I make thy Foes thy footſtool; Pſal.</hi> 110, 1. Here is a Prophecy of Chriſt, <hi>the polished Shaft, hid in Gods Quiver,</hi> as to what he was to be and do in our nature, for exalting it into the Glory, long before, attain'd by him, as Reſurrection-Lamb, and therein, head, not only, to the immortal Spirits of Men and Angels, but, in a peculiar manner, to his ſpiritual Church. He will appear in our glorified nature, at the appointed ſeaſon, for actual ſetting up of his viſible Kingdom, on Earth. Thus may we, with admiration, behold the aſcents
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34311:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> and deſcents of the mediatours creature-building, by which, marvelouſly fitted for preſerving the dignity of his own divinity, and accompliſhing the bleſſednes of his creatures. The aſcent or top of it, is a fitly capacita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted immediate habitation for the divinity. And, the deſcent of it, in <hi>the branch,</hi> is that, wherein Chriſt becoms a two-fold Head to his Angels and Saints, from whom they receive their immortal beings, and alſo the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life and clothing thereof, by which fitted for their manſions in this his Fathers Houſe. This Son and Branch, though but foot-ſtool to himſelf as creature-root and Father; the Throne, on which his divinity ſits, is in a headſhip and preheminency over all bleſſed Angels and Saints, by the appointment of his divine and creature-lord. This foot-ſtool, or loweſt part of the creature-Throne or Houſe of God, in the mediatour, is the immediate object of Faith, as that, by which the divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the top of this creature-Houſe or Throne, inviſible and inacceſſible to his creatures, is let down to them. By this bleſſed medium, are Angels and Saints admitted to the ſight and injoyment of the divine glory, for ever. Chriſt, when on Earth, witneſſed his ſpiritual life, as <hi>Son of man in Heaven,</hi> into which he returned with our nature, and ſo, into that enjoyment of the divine glory, he had, both as creature-root and branch, before the foundation of the World, according to his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. 4, 5. He that deſcended and he that aſcended, is ſtill but one and the ſame Son of man, in the inviſible angelical, and viſible humane Life of the branch; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10. This did he, <hi>that he might fill all things.</hi> In the transformed angelical ſtate, as ſpirit of the branch in his own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-root, <hi>the Son of Man in Heaven,</hi> was he head and parent to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſpirits of Angels and Men, by a firſt creation: and of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al being and ſtate thereof, by a ſecond. In this firſt capacity, as ſpirit of the branch, is Chriſt the heavenly place, in which Angels and Saints have been <hi>bleſſed, as choſen thereunto, before the foundation of the World; Eph.</hi> 1. 3. In the ſecond, as a viſible head to them, in our glorified nature, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he qualified, actually to give them a life of everlaſting bleſſednes, with the never-periſhing meat thereof, the divine and new-creature glories together with the life, in which alone they can ſee and enjoy them, were both and all treaſured up for them, in him. Our exalted nature in him, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the adapted conveyer of his divine, and otherwiſe inviſible, creature-glories, to us. In our glorified nature, he declares the Goſpel, or glad tydings of ſalvation, to men. By this, are they made capable of receiving the joyfull news of <hi>manſions provided for them, in his Fathers Houſe,</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34311:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> of entring into them. No entring for us, but by his entring firſt, in our nature, into the ſtate of everlaſting life. Chriſt, thus, is <hi>the Key of the houſe of David; Iſaiah</hi> 22. 22. In his creature-root, was treaſured up, from everlaſting, the divine glory. This muſt be unlock'd and ſet open, to bleſſed Angels and Saints, by the creature-branch, in the ſecond or viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble capacity of it, even in our exalted nature. This is the myſtical Key that opens his heavenly creature-life, and gives the viſion of the divine glory, to us. By his coming in fleſh, and death and reſurrection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, has he entred into that ſtate, himſelf, as our Head. Spiritual ſaints, under the Law, ſafely ſhut up in the faith of Chriſt's ſo comming and doing for them, rejoyced therein. Chriſt, in his firſt capacity of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-branch, as reſurrection-lamb, in his angelical ſpirit, was the inviſible Door to his own great creature-building, as Root. The very Door, yet, was inviſible, as well as Houſe, and divine Inhabitant. At leaſt, that Door was not opened, nor the divine and creature-glories of the Houſe and Inhabitant, revealed, as now. In our viſible nature, glorified (the ſecond capacity of the branch) does he compleat the Door of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Houſe, and is the ſpiritual Key and Opener thereof, ſo, in both capacities of the Branch, fitted to be the Authour and Finiſher of our Faith. And, ſo was he preſented, at firſt, to Angels and Men, as the compleat Object of their Faith, for the perfecting their Salvation. Bleſſed <hi>Angels</hi> therefore <hi>deſired to prie into</hi> the bleſſed conſequents of the man Chriſt's aſcending, to give ſuch openings of divine and ſpiritual myſteries and glories, as never, before, were given to them or ſaints; 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 11, 12. John 7. 39. Rom. 16. 25, 26. Epheſ.</hi> 3. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Thus, have we the ground and reaſon, why our ſpiritual <hi>Levi</hi> ſtood up, from everlaſting, in the Loins of his great myſtical Father, and that, in the two-fold ſpirit of the Branch, inviſible and viſible, as a twofold natural and ſpiritual Womb and Parent, to bleſſed Angels and Saints. As natural or ſpiritual Children then, to him, are they to pay the like Tithes due from them to him (even the ſpoiles of all, in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by death, and ſacrifice) that the myſtical <hi>Levi,</hi> in his perſon, paid to his ſpiritual <hi>Aaron,</hi> his Root. He requires, from his Children, all the glory, due from the deſcent of his great creature-building, to the aſcent or top thereof; as alſo, from both, to the divinity of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; and, through his conjunctive divine and creature being, to God moſt high and abſolute, in his ſingle or uncompounded divinity. <hi>For, vvithout controverſie, the leſs is bleſſed of the greater,</hi> Heb. 7. 7. And in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34311:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> the due obſervation of this rule, every part of the Mediatour's perſon is preſerved in an abſolute unity, to the praiſe and glory of God moſt high, and Head of all.</p>
            <p>In the great and compleat myſtery of Godlineſs, then, we find a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Headſhip.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt,</hi> Of God, in the ſimple unity of his divine Eſſence, ſoveraign Head to the Mediatour's whole divine and creature-being.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, The headſhip of the firſt and inviſible conjunction of divine and creature-nature in the Mediatour, to the twofold ſpirit of his humanity, in which, properly, <hi>the Branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Branch, alſo, in his twofold humane capacity, is found in an immortal natural, and everlaſting ſpiritual headſhip over bleſſed angels and ſaints, <hi>having in all things a preheminence,</hi> above them all, next under his divine Lord and creature-root, as exalted into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal union, with both.</p>
            <p>Next then, conſider the diſtinct teſtimonies, given by every of theſe head-ſhips, to the preſent truth; the certain viſibility of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> declaring <hi>all povver, in Heaven and Earth,</hi> given to, and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be exerciſed by the man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who, as in our glorified na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhall be ſeen and acknowledged, as, <hi>by God and his Father, made the only Potentate, King of Kings and Lord of Lords; 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 15. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 16. Yet, will not the man Chriſt take the honour of exerciſing this power, unto himſelf, but, make it his buſines to unveil and ſhew the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold diſtinct headſhips over him, in the pure ſingle divinity, and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conjunction of divine and creature-nature. And, both theſe, give their diſtinct teſtimonies to him, as the inviſible, glorified ſon and branch, in order to his viſible exerciſe of univerſal power, therein, over all, as the bleſſed medium, exactly calculated for declaring and execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole mind and will of both, in reference to all Angels and men, good and bad. This could no otherwiſe be diſcovered and done, ſave by the <hi>branch, the man Chriſt.</hi> For, it is below the dignity of the ſingle infinite divinity, the divine eſſence, or, the firſt and higheſt conjunction of divine and creature-nature (or the divine and ſupream creature-form of God, in the Mediatour) immediatly to exerciſe the power, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them both. They, therefore, delegate the exerciſe of this their power, to Chriſt, the branch, as ſet up in the expreſs likeneſs of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory, to whom, therefore, the divinity of the mediatour ſays, <hi>Thou art my Son, that I have begotten</hi> in my own likeneſs, in perſonal union
<pb facs="tcp:34311:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> with me, and appointed thee, <hi>heir of all things; Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 5. Chriſt, as creature-root, is <hi>heir of all,</hi> as the great and ſupream creature-ſpouſe of his own divinity, who brings forth the creature-ſon and branch, in his likeneſs, the viſible Image of his inviſible creature-ſpirit, as that is the inviſible Image of the infinity divine. So is this ſon and branch made viſible <hi>heir of all things,</hi> receiving the power from his own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-root, that his root has, from his own divinity. Hence, when, as glorified branch, brought forth in the viſible likeneſs of his inviſible-creature-root, his root declares him, <hi>his vvel-beloved Son, vvhom all the</hi> ſaints and <hi>Angels of God are to vvorship; Heb.</hi> 1. 6. This, <hi>firſt-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſon and branch,</hi> is the happy and <hi>marveilous day</hi> of the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour's own making, in <hi>vvhich bleſſed Saints and Angels are to rejoyce; Pſal.</hi> 118. 23, 24. For, by this, the divinity in its ſimple unity, and in its firſt and inviſible conjunction with creature-nature, in the mediatour, do firſt give themſelves forth, in a day-break of knowledg and revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to Angels and men. Thus come the diſtinct divine and creature-glories to ſhine forth upon them, through this ſon and branch. And, in their name and power, is he viſibly to rule over all. The title, then, of this branch, to ſuch univerſal Rule, is twofold. For, it deſcends upon him, and is derived to him, firſt, from God, in his ſimple divinity, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute head to the mediatour. Secondly, from the mediatour to Chriſt, in our glorified nature, which is his viſibility, as that, in which, <hi>dvvels the fulneſs of the God-head, bodily; Col.</hi> 2. 9. From this twofold foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and original headſhip over him, has the man Chriſt his right, to the exerciſe of a univerſal viſible rule over all creatures, made ſure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, by their twofold teſtimony to him. But, in poſſeſſing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing this rule, muſt he ſtill acknowledg the twofold head-ſhip of the pure divinity, and firſt conjunction of divine and creature-ſpirit in the mediatour, over him. Theſe are both, in themſelves, inviſible and incommunicable; and, conſequently, at too vaſt a diſtance, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent a height, to have ever been ſeen or approached, by creatures. Their condeſcention, therefore, to have come forth, in either of theſe capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, in a viſibility to angels or men (and ſo, in the immediate exerciſe of the power, eſſential to both the ſaid headſhips over Chriſt, the <hi>branch)</hi> had been too great for them, and unſafe for their creatures. Hence, hath God, of his free Grace, in order to the creation of the World, and communications of himſelf to angels and men, when created, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a twofold diſtinct creature-building and capacity, in the mediatour,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34311:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> the inferiour part, whereof, is exactly fitted to anſwer all the intents and deſigns of God, towards his creatures, as to the declaration and exerciſe of his power over them, and giving the ſafe and comfortable enjoyment of his preſence to them, which, in the two former headſhips, without the branch, would have been <hi>a conſuming fire,</hi> to them; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 29. and <hi>everlaſting burnings,</hi> to any meer creature-organs, natural or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The pure divinity or infinite divine eſſence and Father; and, the firſt, inviſible conjunction of divine with creature-nature, in the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, are, both, above the capacity of immediatly creating angel or man; and then, much more, above the immediate exerciſe of rule, over them.</p>
            <p>But, the whole will of both theſe diſtinct heads to the man Chriſt, is exactly anſwered and executed by the creature-ſon and branch, in the heavenly and immortalized earthly capacity thereof. The twofold glorious creature-building in the mediatour, taken into perſonal union with his divinity, makes up ſuch a bleſſed inſtrument, for doing the whole will of the divine nature, that it is infallibly impoſſible, any thing but the divine will, ſhould be executed, by it. Yet, though each part of the ſaid creature-building live in a perfect voluntary ſubjection to the divine will, the whole does preſerve and retain its own creature-will, in the ſaid ſubjection, diſtinct from the divine.</p>
            <p>And thus have we ſeen the diſtinct teſtimonies of the divine father and ſon, to the twofold capacity of creature-nature, in the mediatour, root and branch. The divine ſon, or form of the divine eſſence and father, from all eternity, is the purely divine likenes and unſeen ſhape of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, the creature-root is the unſeen likeneſs of the divine ſon; but, then, is creature-ſon, or branch, the viſible Image of its own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-root, by which, all divine and creature-glories are let down, to the underſtanding and injoyment of creatures. And, each of theſe Images of God, divine and twofold creaturely, in the mediatour, are, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their diſtinct natures and gradations, the repreſentations or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of each other. And, not only the divine, but ſupream creature-likenes of God, in the mediatour, the original of all creature-beings, on which the ſoveraign power of the divinity deſcended, from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, is of too neer a kin to the divinity, and in too tranſcendent a ſublimity, above any creatures underſtanding, ſight, or enjoyment, to come forth in the immediate exerciſe of the ſoveraign divine power, imparted to it, and committed to its truſt. It is the proper immediate receiver of the divine will, but, above the capacity of executing it. The
<pb facs="tcp:34311:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> declaring and executing the divine Will, is committed to Chriſt, as creature-ſon and branch, exactly fitted for it. This Son and Branch is the body that gives viſibility to the Mediatour's whole divine and great creature-being. And, though inferiour to its creature-root, is it in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal union with it, and the divine nature of the Mediatour (and this, in a twofold reſurrection-life, heavenly and glotified earthly) to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating his perſonality. The two diſtinct Offices of the Mediatour's twofold creature-nature, root and branch, are ſignificantly figured out, by <hi>the Candleſtick all of gold, vvith a bovvl on the top of it;</hi> Zech. 4. 2. This <hi>Bovvl, or Top</hi> of the great creature-building, in the Mediatour, is the fitted immediate reception of the divine mind, in order to the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, by his inferiour creature-capacity, ſignified by the <hi>golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick.</hi> This inferiour part, as living in perſonal union with the ſuperiour, and, through that, with the divinity it ſelf, in the Mediatour, is ſaid to be <hi>God's equal or fellovv,</hi> who, thus <hi>found in the form of God, accounts it no robbery</hi> (or preſumption) <hi>to be equal vvith God;</hi> even in our ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignly exalted nature, as therein fitted to declare and execute the whole will of his divine and creature-lord; <hi>Zech. 13. 7. Phil.</hi> 2. 6. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour creature-capacity of the Mediatour, is the ſecond reception of the divine will and power, which was firſt received by, and treaſured up in his creature-root, and, by that, tranſmitted to its Son and Branch, to exerciſe and execute the ſame, as fitted thereunto. From the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-root, does the branch receive the power of <hi>creating the worlds; Heb.</hi> 1. 2. as alſo, the eſſentials of all Rule and Government. For all theſe undertakes, does the <hi>Son and Branch</hi> become abundantly qualified, through perſonal conjunction with his creature-root and divine Lord; even, to <hi>create all things,</hi> and make Laws, whereby, clearly to ſtate &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the abſolute headſhip of the ſingle divinity, and the Supream Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the firſt conjunction of divine and creature-ſpirits, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour. <hi>The Man Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Son and Branch,</hi> declares the deriving all his power from the two headſhips over him, and his exerciſe thereof in a viſible rule over this world, in perfect ſubjection to them, according to the righteous Laws of his own making. And, he allowes unto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, all ſuch priviledges as are eſſential to their ſpiritual, ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and ſenſual Principles, in the life and exerciſe of their intellectual beings. So, does he render them, according to their creature-liberty, free Agents, as well as immortal ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Thus deep is the foundation laid for the Rule and Power of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb facs="tcp:34311:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Chriſt, as viſibly to be exerciſed by him, in our glorified nature. And, this power does he aſcribe to his conjunctive divine Lord and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-root, and in harmony therewith, to God's abſolute divine unity, as above all, and head to all. Thus, does Jeſus Chriſt, as ſubjected Lord over all, under the ſaid twofold headſhip over him, aſcribe and bring the glory to God moſt high, in his ſingle divinity, the great and high Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all. So, through the happy union of divine and twofold crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-nature, in the Mediatour, may we behold, <hi>the Government of Peace,</hi> under which, bleſſed Saints and Angels are to live everlaſtingly, as ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth <hi>betvveen them both (Zec.</hi> 6. 13.) to wit, both his creature-capacities. In the higher, he is the immediate receiver of the divine mind: in the lower, the executour of the divine will, in all things. This twofold office of the mediatour, is excellently figured out in the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of man's make, and the diſtinct uſefulneſſes thereof, by which, fitted for the compleat exerciſe of his whole being. Yea, the whole perſon of the mediatour, in all the eſſentials of his conſtitution, may fitly be repreſented by what is found in man. For, as a ſhadow of the divinity, his ſpirit or intellectual part is the conceiver of its own will.</p>
            <p>Then, his Soul, as figure of the mediatour's creature-root, is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted reception of the ſaid will and mind of the ſpirit. And thirdly, the will thus conceived by the Spirit, and received by the Soul, muſt be brought into viſible exerciſe and execution, by the third eſſential part in man, the body (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 23.) figure of the inferiour part, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, in the mediatour's creature-nature, as viſible branch to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible creature-root, <hi>in vvhom the god-head</hi> alſo <hi>dvvells bodily,</hi> and ſo becomes viſible to Angels and Saints. Thus, by owning every diſtinct part in the mediatour and in man (and accordingly, aſſigning to them their proper offices) the uſefulnes of the whole, both in type and ſubſtance, is compleated, as alſo, their reſpective perſonalities. And, as the body is put for the whole man, (as that, by which, the inviſible Soul and Spirit are rendred viſible, in the exerciſe thereof, which dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity belongs to it, through its perſonal union with its inviſible Soul and ſpirit) it bears the Title and denomination of the whole man, in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, after the ſame manner as in the ſubſtance, the perſon of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour. Hence, every diſtinct Name of the Mediatour, is applyed to Chriſt, the Branch, as in our nature glorified. For, therein, <hi>the fulneſs of the Godhead dvvels bodily;</hi> and, in perſonal union therewith, ſhines forth viſibly, to Angels and Men.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:34311:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>In the loweſt eſſential part of the Mediatour, in Chriſt the Man-child that's to be manifeſted in the glory of his Father, put upon our exalted nature, in him. And ſo, is <hi>the Government</hi> of his divine and creature-lord, <hi>put upon his Shoulders.</hi> Hence, is he called, by his Father's wonderful Names; <hi>The vvonderful Counſellour, the mighty God, the everlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Prince of Peace;</hi> Iſa. 9. 6. This is a full, ſignificant Prophecy of Chriſt, <hi>the Branch,</hi> in our nature, glorified, as the body and viſibility of the Mediatour, by which, his other, ſuperiour eſſential parts, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſpirit, and creature-ſoul, are brought to light, and rendred viſible to his creatures. So, <hi>is the Man Chriſt Jeſus, the one Mediatour betvveen God and Men;</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. Yet, does not the Mediatour, hereby, loſe either his divine or creature-name, in the firſt conjunction thereof; but, on the contrary, that divine Light, and original Creature-immortality, which was inacceſſible, inviſible and incommunicable to creatures, is made viſible in the Man Chriſt, as glorified and exalted <hi>on the Throne of David,</hi> in perſonal union with his divine and creature-lord, <hi>Of the encreaſe of vvhoſe Government, through the ſaid union, there shall be no end;</hi> verſ. 7. For hereby, is this happy <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> abundantly qualified, to execute and fulfill the whole divine and creature-will. And ſo, through the perfect ſubjection of the viſible body, our exalted nature in him, to the inviſible creature-ſoul and divine ſpirit, is the will of God, and of the whole perſon of the mediatour, declared and fulfilled. The will of all, is manifeſted and done, by the actual ſetting up of the kingdom, over which, Chriſt is to reign, as ſon and branch, in the glory of his divine Lord and creature-father. This is ſignificantly figured out, by <hi>Hilkiam</hi> the Father, and <hi>Eliakim,</hi> the Son; holding forth this relation of our myſtical <hi>Eliakim,</hi> the branch, bearing the ſame date with his ſpiritual root, and father, <hi>Hilkiam,</hi> in his inviſible angelical life, that he had in his root, from everlaſting. And, in his appointed time, muſt <hi>all the glory of his Fathers houſe</hi> be viſibly <hi>put upon our nature, in him,</hi> on earth, as inviſibly inherited and poſſeſſed by him, in Heaven. So comes he to be clothed with the twofold Robes of myſtical <hi>Hilkiam,</hi> his root and father, when this ſon and branch ſhall appear in the viſible exerciſe of all power in heaven and earth, eſſentially belonging to the <hi>Throne of his Fathers glory.</hi> And then, will his father viſibly place this his ſon, on the ſaid Throne, as <hi>clothed vvith his Robes and ſtrengthned vvith his girdle,</hi> to exerciſe his whole Government, put into his hands. As the diſtinct Teſtimonies of the Mediatour, in his inviſible divine and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-natures,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34311:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> will he viſibly ſet his creature-ſon and branch, <hi>on his holy Hill of Sion,</hi> committing to him the exerciſe of all his own rule and power, in a viſible dominion <hi>over that Houſe of Juda and Iſrael,</hi> that comprehends the whole heavenly and glorified earthly family of Chriſt. The ſeaſon for this, hath yet been, by God, kept in reſerve, figured by the clothing of litteral <hi>Eliakim,</hi> in which, Chriſt, our myſtical <hi>Eliakim,</hi> as ſon to the mediatour, his inviſible father, is to have all the diſtinct glories of that myſtical fellowſhip and unity, that his divine and inviſible creature-nature live in, ſo <hi>hung upon him,</hi> as to be viſibly ſeen and acknowledged by the whole world. Their diſtinct teſtimonies will be known and owned at that ſecond comming of Chriſt, in our glorified nature, in which he will cauſe to ſhine forth his inviſible conjunction of divine and creature-nature. And ſo alſo, by the man Chriſt, ſhall be Adminiſtred and given forth the diſtinct and differing meaſures of his fathers divine glory, as the everlaſting Portions of bleſſed Angels and Saints, according to their reſpective receptivities, as veſſels of greater or leſs capacity, even <hi>from Cups to Flagons.</hi> And, in this univerſal Kingdom of his Father, ſhall the Man Chriſt be eſtabliſhed, as <hi>a Nail in a ſure Place,</hi> for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And, by him, ſhall bleſſed Angels and Saints aſcribe the glory, due to the purely divine nature, and the inviſible conjunction of divine and creature-nature. The Son and Branch acknowledges, all his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be from his God and Father, in perſonal union with him. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that, <hi>of himſelf,</hi> in our ſingle fleſhly nature, <hi>he could do nothing;</hi> and that he receives all his ruling power, as exalted into perſonal union with his God and Father, therein. Thus comes the Son and Branch to be poſſeſſed of all the ſtrength and power of the Mediatours whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And, ſo is enabled, not only to <hi>ſee,</hi> but <hi>do all things. Whatever the Father doth, that doth the Son, alſo.</hi> For, all the Power of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through perſonal union, becomes the Son's. The ſame Will lives in both. But, this Will, as living in the Father, cannot be declared to, or received by creatures, but as deſcending to, and manifeſted by the Son. On this ground, Chriſt himſelf declares, <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgement to the Son.</hi> So, the whole will of the Father is executed by the Son. Hence, in obedience to the Father, <hi>All muſt honour the Son as they honour the Father.</hi> Thus does Chriſt ſhew, how all that power, which, originally, is his Fathers, comes to be his; and, that all which is his, thus again, becomes his Father's; and he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes the ſame, in perfect ſubjection to his Father. Yet, is the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34311:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the ſon, diſtinct from the divine will, though one with it, through perſonal union with the divine. In this union, and abſolute ſubjection, will Chriſt, as ſon and branch, rule his ſpiritual kingdom, as declarer and doer of the divine mind, which could, no otherwiſe, be known or done. Chriſt would not put any weight on himſelf, in the will of our ſingle fleſhly nature; Yet, <hi>is he one that beares a</hi> diſtinct record or <hi>vvitneſs</hi> to himſelf; and will, by the command of his Father, give it unto him, as exalted into perſonal union with God; and, as ſo, the truth, he told the Jews, worthy of their belief. For, in our exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nature, is he the only immediate object of faith, to Angels and men, and the only way and means for their knowing, or comming to, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Chriſt juſtified his <hi>bearing vvitneſs to himſelf,</hi> as thus conſidered, to the Jews, on their offence at his owning himſelf in this union with the father, as <hi>knovving vvhence he came, and vvhether be vvas to go.</hi> He knew, he was to return, by way of reſurrection, into that life, whence he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, as ſpirit of the branch, into our fleſhly nature, in which, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the divine <hi>glory of his father,</hi> through union with his root, <hi>before the foundation of the World;</hi> and this, for the compleating his mediatour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. So is there a threefold diſtinct will in the mediatour, in perfect unity. This was figured by the <hi>tvvo or three vvitneſſes,</hi> under the Law, whoſe joynt teſtimony was ſufficient, to pronounce ſentence of Life or Death, on any one. For, ſo will that will of the mediatour, be, which ſhall be pronounced, by Chriſt, in our glorified nature, as the mouth and viſible declarer of the united wills, in his whole perſon. His glorified humane will, though the loweſt, through perfect union with the higher and higheſt, becomes equally authentick with them, in its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct witneſs. So, over the kingdom that deſcends to him, by the gift of his father, will he exerciſe a viſible rule, in his new-creation life and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, at his ſecond comming. Chriſt's own teſtimony to this his ſpiritual kingdom, at his ſecond appearance, did coſt him the life of his firſt. And, thereby did he <hi>finish his vvork on earth,</hi> even in his ſingle earthly humanity, that he had, long before, perfected, in his inviſible angelical ſtate. The viſible repetition thereof, he was neither afraid nor aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, before the evil powers of this world. For, when, by the Jews, brought before <hi>Pilate,</hi> he poſitively aſſerted; he had a kingdom; but, of a ſpiritual nature, and not of this World, to be brought to light, by the death of our earthly nature, in him. The joy of his ſpiritual life, ſtate, and kingdom; ſet before him, made him-willingly take the bitter Cup
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34311:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> of death to his natural ſpirit, as the only way and paſſage to the ſaid ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life and kingdom, wherein to exerciſe the whole of the divine and creature-power of the mediatour.</p>
            <p>Having then ſeen the diſtinct teſtimonies to this viſible ſpiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the man Chriſt, from the threefold will of divine and twofold creature-nature, in the mediatour; we are, next, to conſider the diſtinct teſtimony, given to the ſame, by the true ſpirit of ſaintſhip, in all Ages. In order to this enquiry, conſider firſt, what is the ſpirit of true ſaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that has, from generation to generation, given teſtimony to the viſible ſpiritual reign and kingdom of Chriſt. This ſpirit of ſaintſhip is at a great diſtance from the divinity; yea, perfectly diſtinct from the firſt, immediate conjunction of the divine and creature-names or natures of the mediatour, on the one hand; and from the ſingle firſt-creation name, nature, or ſpirit, on the other. The true ſpirit of ſaintſhip, in the members of Chriſt's Heavenly or Earthly glorified body, is found allwayes, in a true ſubjection to the man Chriſt, as their new-creature Lord and Head. And, yet, in their ſubjected places, under him, are they joyned with him, in a headſhip over the whole natural, firſt-creation ſtate, which is the Woman, that in the ſaints, as well as in Chriſt, muſt own the new-creation ſpirit or man, in both, for head. Yet, the ſaint, thus joyned in a ſtate of ſpiritual headſhip, with his head, is in a ſtate of ſubjection to the Prerogative headſhip, belonging to every part of the mediatours being, divine or creaturely. The higheſt Saint, in his moſt heavenly exaltation, into new-creation glory, remains for ever in a ſingle creaturality, as his diſtinguiſhing make, from the glorious perſon of the mediatour. But, as the ſaint muſt not aſſume the peculiar two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold divine and creature-name of Chriſt, ſo muſt he not be denied a new-creation name, through participation of, and union with the new-creature ſpirit of Chriſt, in which highly exalted above his own firſt-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion life, name, or nature, as far as heaven is above the earth. For, the ſpirit of man, at higheſt, in firſt-covenant life, is but earth, or of the <hi>earth, earthy.</hi> Though it be, in dignity and power, placed over all things below it ſelf <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 8. 6.) yet is it inferiour to what is ſpiritual and heavenly. <hi>He cannot</hi> ſo much as <hi>diſcern things ſpiritual.</hi>
'Tis as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for it to go beyond the ſphere and bounds of its natural activity, as for the brute Beaſt to exceed his bounds, and Judge of things rational. Nothing below the ſpirit of man, wanting his intellectual and rational faculties, can diſcern the proper <hi>things of man.</hi> So, nor
<pb facs="tcp:34311:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> can man's intellectual or rationall powers, exerciſed only in a natural, or firſt-covenant light, judg of, or comprehend the things of that ſpiritual, new-creation ſtate, which is ſuperiour to it. This is the peculiar, eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al priviledg of the true ſaint, in new-creation life. This capacitates him, not onely, to know all things below it ſelf, and all its own, ſpiritual, heavenly things; but to ſearch out, find, and ſee the moſt <hi>deep</hi> and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>things of the very</hi> infinite <hi>divinity; 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 9-15. This great priviledge, coms ſaints to, by partaking of the new-creature ſpirit of Chriſt, which God has promiſed in his new and everlaſting covenant, made, on their behalf, with their miſtical father <hi>Abraham,</hi> Chriſt himſelf, to ſet up in them. This new-covenant ſpirit is perfectly diſtinct, in the nature of it, from the firſt. This is ſpiritual, that natural: This, heavenly; that earthly. In the pure natural, earthly, firſt-covenant ſpirit, Chriſt was a huſband to Angels and man, in innocency, before the fall of either. But, in this myſtical Land of pure nature, did all men, in and with the firſt, and many Angels, fall off from Chriſt, and ſo loſt their firſt-covenant ſpouſal relation to him. No ſuch apoſtacy or chang is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the ſecond covenant gift. The relation of God and creatures, founded in that, can never be forfeited or loſt. When God, by way of diſtinction from the firſt-creation ſpirit (in which firſt-covenant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, and relation to him, is founded) ſayes, <hi>he vvill vvrite</hi> or put <hi>his nevv-covenant Lavv</hi> or ſpirit <hi>in</hi> his. Peoples <hi>hearts, they shall never depart from him, nor, vvill he, from them;</hi> Then <hi>are they his People, for ever,</hi> and can never again, become <hi>no People,</hi> as his firſt-covenant People do, after all communications from him, and communion with him, therein; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31-33. and, 32, 40. By the freſh gift of his firſt-covenant ſpirit, <hi>he brought them out of the houſe of bondage,</hi> the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſpirit or ſtate of nature, Typed by <hi>Egypt. But this his covenant they brake, though he vvas a Husband to them, therein.</hi> This evidenced the changable nature, and life of that ſpirit, in which this covenant was founded, and undertaken to be managed, on mans part. But, the new-creature, or ſecond covenant ſpirit, in the true ſaint, is a principle of everlaſting righteouſneſs, and infallible truth. This fit's man for perſonal union with the fountain thereof, in the man Chriſt, and ſo, for everlaſting obedience, with the ſame ſpirit in him, to the divinity, it ſelf. The whole divine will or law is written out, in this ſpirit, the true ſaint is of, and in unchangable union with. The life of this ſpirit, then, in ſaints, enables them to read, know and do the divine Law and will, as the
<pb facs="tcp:34311:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſaid ſpirit, in Chriſt himſelf. In this ſpirit, as a myſtical table, is the divine Law ſo powerfully written out, as to cauſe immutable obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in all the partakers thereof. <hi>It never ſins, nor can ſin,</hi> in Chriſt or ſaint; any, <hi>born thereof,</hi> that <hi>live and vvalk therein, 1 Jo.</hi> 3. 9. The ſaint, in this ſpirit, that is of a ſpiritual, heavenly, nature, <hi>is no more a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> as in the former, natural, changable, earthly, firſt-covenant or firſt-creation ſtate, life, ſpirit (in which, it is impoſſible to know his Lords ſpiritual mind, things, and ſecrets) but, with <hi>Abraham, a friend of God,</hi> enabled to know, not only the ſecret things of his heavenly, ſpiritual creature-mind, but divine alſo; <hi>the deep things, the vvhole counſel of God,</hi> about the ſalvation of men. <hi>Chriſt promiſes to reveal to</hi> ſuch <hi>friends, all that the father has made knovvn to him; Jo.</hi> 15. 15. The new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſpirit, partaken of, from Chriſt, becomes, in the quickened up ſeed thereof, a new ſpiritual life, light, nature, name, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, in ſaints. By it, are they fitted to take in the viſions of the divine glory. For, this ſpirit, in Chriſt, is in perſonal union with the divine. In him, it receives the whole divine glory, which, from him, deſcends and is let down to all his ſpiritual members. By this bleſſed medium, his new-creature-ſpirit, (by which, they are made lively Stones in his new-creature City and Temple) muſt they, for ever, receive the viſion of the divine glory. A portion of this ſpirit in them, is the <hi>nevv Ear</hi> or intellect, by which they are enabled to hear and underſtand that voice of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual King, that gives forth the divine and new-creature will of their Lord, in one ſound; and to feed on that viſion of the divine glory, which is the Manna, hid from all natural underſtanding, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing, any creature can receive. So, though the ſaints name be not the reſult of divine and creature-nature, in one perſon, Chriſts pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar prerogative, yet is it a partaking of that new-creature name or nature of Chriſt, which, even in him, is preſerved in a diſtinction from his divine, though in perſonal union with it. Though higheſt ſaints may not pretend to the priviledg of the loweſt part of the mediatours creature-nature or name, to wit, perſonal union with the divinity, yet, are they partakers of the higher part of his creature-nature, as well as lower, yea all ſpiritual ſaints do partake of the twofold or ſingle new-creature ſpirit of their head, as their peculiar names of ſaint-ſhip, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and derived from him, <hi>to, and in vvhich, choſen and bleſſed, before the foundation of the vvorld; Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4. By virtue of the fathers choice, and the ſons peculiar work-manſhip upon them, are they
<pb facs="tcp:34311:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> brought into a living union with his new-creature-ſpirit; and ſo, ſafely returned into their prepared places, to enjoy, according to the fathers diſtinct choice of them, their reſpective viſions of the divine glory, in the relation of Spouſe, Friends, or Servants. So have every of them <hi>their joy, full and compleat.</hi> But, none of them exceed the nature or name of a pure new-creature ſpiritual man. What ever their portion of his new-creature-ſpirit be, ſingle or double, capacitating them to receive and enjoy a ſingle or double portion in the viſion of the divine glory; yet, are they all, but new-creature ſpiritual men, filled with the viſion of God, according to their diſtinct capacites. This new creature-ſpirit of ſaintſhip, through the perſonal union of it with God, in Chriſt, is called the ſpirit of God. Hence, is it an infallible mark of a true ſaint to have <hi>this ſpirit dvvelling in him.</hi> This ſpirit of God <hi>(Ro:</hi> 8, 9.) is, in the ſame verſe, called <hi>the ſpirit of Chriſt,</hi> diſtinct from the divine ſpirit of Father or Son, divine eſſence or form. The Seed of this new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſpirit in ſaints, is called, alſo, the ſeed of God (1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 9.) Which preſerves the ſaint from ſuch wilful ſin and enmity in his natural ſpirit, or carnal mind, as would be eternal death to him; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 6, 7. The deſires, and appetites of the fleſhly or carnal, natural mind and ſpirit, in the ſaint himſelf, till ſubjected to his ſpiritual, are after that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate which is death. But, at ſame time, the mind of the new-creature ſpirit, though hid from his own heart, in which ſown, God and Chriſt do ſee, to be after that life, which gives everlaſting peace with God. The ſpiritual ſeed, quickened up in the ſaint, is, in all its life and motion, purely obedient to Chriſt, and by its powerful influences upon the natural ſpirit, will not ceaſe to teach and beget in that, the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable ſubjection to it ſelf, and ſo of the whole ſaint, to Chriſt, and God moſt high. And, as ſubjection and love to God, is natural to the new-creation-ſpirit; diſobedience and enmity to God, is grown natural to the old or firſt, ſince the fall. Hence, is it <hi>impoſſible,</hi> therein, <hi>to pleaſe God; Ro. 8. 8. Paul,</hi> therefore, rejoyced in that work of the Croſs, by which his natural mind was brought into a like ſubjection to his ſpiritual, as that, to Chriſt. Through this ſubjection of the natural to the ſpiritual, and ſo, of the whole man, to Chriſt, have ſaints the certain witneſs of Chriſt's ſpirit, dwelling in them. <hi>His ſpirit beares vvitneſs,</hi> not only, in, but <hi>to them, that they are the Children of God,</hi> Members of and Coheirs with Chriſt, therein, of God. <hi>Ro.</hi> 8. 17. The new-creature-ſpirit, from its univerſal obedience to God, in head and members, is called <hi>love,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:34311:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. It is that, in which only God becomes the object of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures unchangable love, and they, of his. The natural ſpirit is deſcribed by <hi>fear. 1 John. 4. 18. Perfect love caſteth out fear.</hi> The ſpiritual life of love, perfected in the ſaint, the life of his natural ſpirit, with all its things, thoughts, luſts, carnal reaſonings, doubtings, and feares, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, aboliſhed, and caſt out. They that dwell, live, and walk in the ſpirit of Chriſt (which, in him, is in perſonal union with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine) are ſaid to dwell in God. <hi>He that dvvelleth in love, dvvelleth in God; and God, in him; verſ</hi> 16. God has declared the height of his love, and greatnes of his condeſcention, in this marveilous contriving a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage union of divine and creature-nature, by which, to preſerve his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity from being touched, or immediatly beheld by ſaints; and to come forth, in ſuch a ſafe and ſutable diſcovery thereof, to his creatures, through the man Chriſt, as to be a food of everlaſting bleſſedneſs, to them. <hi>The ſaint is</hi> made <hi>one vvith the</hi> new-creature-<hi>ſpirit of Chriſt, as that, vvith God; Jo.</hi> 17. 21. That ſpirit of Chriſt is the bleſſed ſhelter, and fitted medium, by which the divine viſion is given to ſaints, ſo as not to be <hi>a conſuming fire, to them.</hi> Saints, by partaking of this ſpirit, become parts and <hi>Pillars of that nevv</hi>-creation <hi>ſanctuary,</hi> Gods <hi>place of meeting vvith the vvhole congregation of his true Iſraelites, Angels and Saints, amongſt vvhom he vvill dvvell and vvalk, for evermore.</hi> In this ſpirit, have they all, an acceſſe unto, and viſion of the divine glory, yet partake not of the divinity, as an ingredient into the conſtitution of their perſons. But, by partaking of that ſpirit, that from perſonal union with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, in Chriſt, is called God, <hi>(Jo.</hi> 1. 1.) they are ſaid to <hi>partake of the divine nature; 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4. The creature-ſpirit of Chriſt, is <hi>the holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in, and upon ſaints, by vvhich they knovv all things. The holy Oil, or Ointment,</hi> of his heavenly and glorified earthly ſpirit, <hi>runs dovvn, from their high-prieſt, to the lovveſt Skirts of his</hi> new-creation <hi>Garments,</hi> or meaneſt ſpiritual Members. <hi>This ſpirit,</hi> in Chriſt and ſaints, <hi>is Truth and no Lie;</hi> an infallible ſpirit, in head and members, diſtinct from the divine ſpirit in Chriſt, and natural ſpirit of man or Angel, at beſt. The loweſt capacity of creature-nature in the mediatour, is above the higheſt ſaint. The ſpouſal ſaint, one with Chriſt, in his moſt heavenly and exalted creature-life, ſees not or enjoyes the divine glory as the loweſt part of creature-nature in Chriſt, does, by perſonal union therewith. The new-creature ſpirit, in its higheſt and moſt heavenly, or loweſt earthly glorified life, is inferiour to the divine, but, ſuperiour to the firſt-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34311:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſpirit of nature, at beſt, becauſe incorruptible and unchangable in the life and goodneſs thereof. In the firſt, being corruptible and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>man is in perpetual bondage and fear,</hi> as impoſſible to be ſecured from death, therein; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. This therefore, was never intended, by God, for an abiding ſtate of reſt and true bleſſednes, to Angel or man, not being a ſpirit of unchangable light and life, or that can qualify them to receive the viſion of the divine glory. This ſhews the abſolute neceſſity of the ſaints being <hi>clothed vvith a Houſe from Heaven,</hi> by the new-creating <hi>vvorkmanship of Chriſt,</hi> for his everlaſting bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, then, it appeares to be the peculiar privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the mediatour, to be, in every part of his creature-nature, in perſonal union with the divine. Conſequently, is it a crime, equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, for any creature to deny to him, or aſſume to himſelf, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive divine and creature-name. His comprehenſive creature-ſpirit or nature, is the living Book, wherein the whole divine mind or Law is written, in order to be declared to Angels and men. If <hi>any man,</hi> then, <hi>or Angel from heaven</hi> ſhall dare, on pretence of adding thereto, to make Chriſt's perſon, only and purely divine (and ſo, divide and take from him, his creature-nature, which is the ſupream Book and Table, on which the divine mind is engraven, and, by which, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory ſhines forth to his creatures) or on the other hand, derogate and take from the authority of this moſt authentick Book of the divine mind, by denying Chriſt's divinity, and owning him, only as the moſt excellent creature-being; this twofold fault of adding to, or taking from this Book, will be declared equal, by the equal puniſhment of both, eternal death. <hi>Neither</hi> of them <hi>shall have any part in the life and bleſſings of the ſaid Book, but only in the plagues</hi> and wrath, <hi>vvritten</hi> and treaſured up <hi>in it,</hi> for ſuch offenders; <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18, 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 34. No leſſe then ſo, is the danger and guilt, in denying the conjunction of divine and creature-ſpirit, as the peculiar conſtitution of the mediatour, the only means of creating Angels and men, and of revealing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory to them, in their ſecond and ſpiritual make. To deny this, is to deny the creation, on, at leaſt, any poſſibility for creatures beholding or enjoying God. The foundation of their bleſſedneſs is layd in the union of two natures, in the mediatour, as the utmoſt reſult of Gods free love, and contrivance of his divine wiſdom. The deep founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of creatures bleſſednes, was laid in the firſt, inviſible fellowſhip of divine and creature-nature, in the mediatour. The actual giving this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34311:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> bleſſedneſs to them, is, by the loweſt part of his new-creature-ſpirit, and communication thereof to them, to qualify them for receiving the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine viſion.</p>
            <p>Having thus found out the ſpirit of true ſaintſhip, let us conſider the diſtinct teſtimony to the preſent truth, the viſible kingdom and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall reign of Chriſt, given by ſaints in all ages. <hi>Enoch the ſeventh from Adam propheſied</hi> this ſabbatical reſt and kingdom; <hi>Jude</hi> 14, 15. To enumerate every particular herein, were endleſſe; when, from the whole courſe of ſcripture, it may be obſerved, that the final reſult and utmoſt end of every diſpenſation, has been, to point out the inviſible ſtate of truth, which, by Chriſt's ſecond appearance, was alwayes by God deſigned, to be made manifeſt. For, though Chriſt, in that inviſible Angelical life, he had from everlaſting, in his root, were, to the Seed of faith, before and under the Law, <hi>a Land of diſtances, very far off (Eſay.</hi> 33. 17.) Yet, by faith, <hi>ſavv they this</hi> ſpiritual <hi>King, in the beauty, of his</hi> new-creation <hi>glory,</hi> as the reſurrection-Lamb. This ſight of him, through faith, became the ſpiritual food, on which they lived. And, in <hi>this faith, they died,</hi> with a ſteadfaſt hope to partake thereof. This hope became to them, <hi>the Waters that failed not, and the bread by</hi> which they were nouriſhed up, unto eternal life. The viſion hereof, by <hi>faith, vvas the ſubſtance of thoſe things,</hi> after, to be manifeſted. And they rejoyced in the meanes, they, by faith, diſcerned, for the manifeſtation thereof Chriſt, in the Angelical life of the ſpirit of the branch, was, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the object of faith, to Angels and men. And, in that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible life and ſtate, was laid the ſure foundation of his viſible kingdom, here ſpoken to. As thus ſeen and underſtood, he and his Kingdom, have been witneſſed by true ſaints, from firſt to laſt. <hi>In this Archangel, did God,</hi> from the beginning, ſo <hi>put his divine name,</hi> as, thereby, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Moſes</hi> his experience, to give the view of his one divinity, which otherwiſe, had remained abſolutely inviſible to any meer creatures. By this means, did ſaints, under the law-diſpenſation, look into that ſpiritual <hi>Canaan</hi> into which, they nor did nor could enter, till their ſpiritual <hi>Joshua or Jeſus</hi> went before them, thereinto. <hi>The holy Ghoſt vvas not given till Jeſus vvas glorified; Joh.</hi> 7. 39. The diſcerning this, by faith (before Chriſt's comming in fleſh) even his viſible rule over Angels and men, in our glorified nature, appears; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 3, 4. where 'tis ſaid, <hi>He vvill be juſt,</hi> becauſe <hi>ruling in the</hi> true <hi>fear</hi> and perfect love <hi>of God,</hi> over the whole earth. And <hi>this man</hi> Chriſt, that will ſo rule, <hi>vvill be abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34311:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> place from the Wind, and a covert from the ſtorm, as the</hi> comforting <hi>shade</hi> of that great and high <hi>Rock,</hi> the mediatours firſt and inviſible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and creature-conjunction, wherein, unacceſſible to the higheſt ſaint. Through the branch, as their bleſſed ſhade, do they condeſcend to ſhine forth, to the unſpeakable comfort of all ſaints, from the higheſt to the loweſt. They do all, in the twofold ſpiritual, reſurrection-life of the branch, receive thoſe beams of the divine and moſt glorious Sun, that without ſuch an interpoſing ſhade (Chriſt's exalted humanity, in which he is the ſaints covert) would be a conſuming fire to them, from the vaſt diſtance and infinite diſproportion of the object and ſubject. The glorified man Chriſt, becomes the ſafe defence of ſaints, as fitting them for Gods looking down with favour upon them, and their look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to, and beholding him, to their everlaſting comfort. As united with his glorified humanity, they enjoy, for ever, his divinity. The man Chriſt then, in our glorified nature, will, in anſwer to the ſight of faith, in all ages, and unceſſant deſires of his Angels and ſaints, actually <hi>

Then <hi>shall he be as the light of that morning,</hi> which is to ſucceed the diſmally dark Night of mans degenerate day, under Satan's reign, <hi>the Lightning out of the Eaſt, that shall shine even unto the Weſt,</hi> over all, in a moment; 2 <hi>Sam. 23. 4. Mat. 24. 27. This viſion, David</hi> had, with other ſaints, by faith, <hi>vvas made to ſpeake,</hi> by the comming, death, and reſurrection of Chriſt, in our nature, in which were comprehended all that died in the faith thereof, who then came actually to partake of that life and glory, which, <hi>by faith, they knevv, vvas to be revealed,</hi> or ſet open, in Chriſts perſon. By faith, did they ſee their bleſſed lot in the ſaid ſpiritual ſtate, and divine viſion, is thus to be given in Chriſt's perſon, by whoſe preſence in fleſh, and performances therein, the ſhadowy ceremonies, and types of the Law, <hi>fled avvay,</hi> through which, till then, ſaints faith did feed on the inviſible ſubſtance, as <hi>the good things to come,</hi> in which they rejoyced.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34311:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> inviſible ſtate, <hi>as the Lamb ſlain before the foundation of the World,</hi> the object of their faith. And, they knew, all would be made viſible, in our nature, by him. In both theſe reſpects, was he the object of all their deſire and delight. This was their bed of reſt, whether in or out of the body, patiently waiting for, and <hi>diligently enquiring vvhat manner of time the ſpirit in them did ſignifie, vvhen it teſtified before hand the ſuffering of Chriſt, and glory that should follovv. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 11. And, <hi>it vvas revealed to them, that not unto themſelves, but us</hi> (under the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-diſpenſation, witneſſes both of his comming in fleſh, and ſtate of grace, or reſurrection-life, which was to follow) <hi>they did miniſter ſuch things.</hi> The Apoſtles and other Saints, in the goſpel-day, received <hi>that ſpirit, not before given, Jo.</hi> 7. 39. by which, <hi>the myſtery of Godlineſs</hi> became opened, even through Chriſts being <hi>manifeſted in flesh, juſtified in ſpirit, and, in our nature, exalted into heaven.</hi> All this, viſibly accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Chriſt's perſon, is the ſum and ſubſtance of the goſpel-teſtimony. The reſurrection-ſtate is, now, no longer, <hi>a land of diſtances, very far off,</hi> but brought neer, and ſet open in Chriſt's glorified humanity. Hence, is the goſpel-diſpenſation much more ſpiritual then that of the Law, the object of faith being now brought into ſight; though ſpiritual ſaints under both theſe diſpenſations, found a like acceptation with God. <hi>The elders and worthies</hi> under the Law, <hi>vvere, through their</hi> powerful <hi>faith, pleaſing to God, Heb.</hi> 11. 39. as well as ſpiritual-ſaints, under the goſpel. <hi>They obtained a good report by faith. They;</hi> willingly and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully confeſſed themſelves <hi>ſtrangers, on earth,</hi> or, as to their natural ſtate and principle, though not actually poſſeſſed of the ſpiritual and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>This better thing vvas kept,</hi> in reſerve, as neither given to, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them, in ſuch manner as after Chriſts comming, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of their bleſſedneſs, and finiſhing of that faith, he was authour of, before. But, the whole ſeed of faith, ſpiritual ſaints, before and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Law and Goſpel, agree in their witneſs to Chriſt's reſurrection-ſtate, as that new <hi>name</hi> and life, <hi>vvherein</hi> alone, <hi>any</hi> ever were, or <hi>can be ſaved,</hi> or receive the viſion of the divine glory. And, though <hi>the goſpel-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration be more glorious then that of the Lavv,</hi> as a ballance to this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of ſaints under the goſpel, <hi>thoſe under the Lavv vvere</hi> made <hi>the firſt-fruits unto Chriſt,</hi> in his reſurrection-ſtate, in our nature. For, to their <hi>impriſoned ſpirits, shut up in the faith,</hi> of what was to be revealed, <hi>Chriſt appeared, and in the</hi> firſt degree of his reſurrection-life, <hi>preached it to them,</hi> or beſtowed it on them, rendring the ſtate of thoſe juſt ſpirits, a paradiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:34311:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> by entring among them, in his reſurrection-life and glory. And, after this, <hi>he poured forth his</hi> glorified <hi>ſpirit,</hi> on ſaints, in the body, which rendred them powerful, experimental witneſſes of his reſurrection-life, and new name. Thus, the whole generation of faith (whether as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical meſſengers, before Chriſts comming in fleſh, or declarers of him, after come) have all, moſt harmoniouſly agreed in their teſtimony to the ſpiritual nature and viſibility of Chriſt's kingdom, here treated on.</p>
            <p>And thus having ſeen the teſtimony of the divine nature itſelf, and the infallible creature-teſtimony of Chriſt and his ſaints, to this truth; as a ſecondary general confirmation of it, we may obſerve the various types and figures in Gods providential workings, for ſtrengthning his Peoples faith in this important truth. Even, before the fall, every voice of God to man, was, to point out this ſpiritual State of Reſt, he was to look after. But, all this counſel of God, was neglected by him. Yet, did God, even after the fall, and before the giving of the Law, warn <hi>Noah</hi> of this his twofold great deſign, to wit, of taking down the old, or firſt creation-World, and ſetting up that new one, in which, to eſtabliſh this viſible kingdom of Chriſt. As a token hereof, <hi>vvas he commanded to build an Ark,</hi> and, by his obedience to God, therein, <hi>did he condemn that</hi> ſinful <hi>World,</hi> which wilfully neglected the voice of God, therein. But, <hi>Noah,</hi> by faith, ſaw Chriſt in that reſurrection or kingdom-ſtate, figured by the Ark, as a ſpiritual Rock of ſafety to himſelf and whole ſpiritual ſeed, from that deſtruction, figured out by the floud, which, all Angels and men, that obſtinately fix themſelves in the old World, or firſt-creation ſtate, againſt God and the ſecond, bring upon themſelves. And, this deluge or deſtruction of man-kind, by water, points out the far greater deſtruction by fire, in that <hi>day of the Lord,</hi> wherein he will deſtroy the very heavens and earth, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, reſerved, for the exerciſe of Gods long-ſuffering. For, their abuſe of all, will ripen them for a final conſumption, by the fire of God's wrath; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. Then, even amidſt thoſe flames, will he, moſt certainly, ſet up that ſpiritual kingdom, in which, ſhall be a like viſible protection and ſafty to his ſaints, as <hi>Noahs</hi> litteral Ark was, to him and his family.</p>
            <p>The next remarkable type of this ſpiritual truth, before the giving of the Law, was <hi>Abrahams</hi> conqueſt of the four Kings, as figuring out, not only, the corrupt, but righteous principles of nature, in men and Angels, which, as ſingly naturall, are all, in a combined intereſt, againſt the ſpiritual ſeed of faith, and Chriſt, their head. Theſe are ſignified
<pb facs="tcp:34311:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſon and his followers. And, their victory was a type fthe compleat and final conqueſt, our ſpiritual Lord <hi>Abraham,</hi> with all his ſaints, will obtain, over all that come againſt them, to oppoſe the ſetting up of his ſpiritual kingdom, viſibly in the world.</p>
            <p>After this, have we another ſignal figure hereof, in Gods remarkable dealing with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as his enemies, on behalf of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> his friends, in his marvellous wayes of puniſhing the one, and delivering the other, by his own right hand and out-ſtretched arm. Both were types of that irreſiſtable power, in which, Chriſt, in theſe laſt dayes of greateſt bondage and oppreſſion to his people, will give them a more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deliverance then ever. In theſe laſt and worſt of times, will be a combination, in religious and civil principles, againſt them, figured by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> powers, and the <hi>Magicians;</hi> by the latter, counterfeiting, and, by the former, perſecuting the new-creation ſpirit and power, they both hate, which Chriſt is ready to break forth in, and, thereby, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on his ſpiritual <hi>Iſraelites</hi> an abſolute deliverance out of all their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral and myſtical captivities. And, by the ſame power, will he ſo judge and deal with his enemies, of all ſorts, as never to ſuffer them to riſe up, more, againſt him or his ſpiritual <hi>Iſraelites. Moſes</hi> his whole govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the ſanctuary and other things in his miniſtration, were ſpeaking figures and ſignificant voices of this univerſal kingdom of Chriſt. No circumſtance, in the civil or religious conſtitution of that government, but, remarkably ſignified the preſent truth. And, by ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſounds of his providence, under every diſpenſation, has the Lord been declaring, and ſetting this truth, before the faith of his People. The ſanctuary or tabernacle was not to be fixed, as in its reſting-place, till his People were poſſeſſed of their reſting-place, the typical Land of promiſe. Next this, was <hi>Solomon's</hi> Temple, on various accounts, a ſignal type of Chriſt, and of what he was to do. The taking it down, by the <hi>Babylonian</hi> power, and the rebuilding it, in <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> his dayes, by the command of God, were figures of the firſt and ſecond comming of Chriſt. He took down himſelf, in his firſt and fleſhly building in our nature, by a holy death; and raiſed himſelf up, therein, into a ſpiritual, everlaſting righteous life, in which he will ſet up his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kingdom, on earth. <hi>The ſecond litteral Temple,</hi> in reference to this ſpiritual new building of our nature, in Chriſt's perſon (in which, viſibly to rule and reign over all) <hi>is ſaid, greatly to have exceeded the</hi> beauty or <hi>glory of the firſt;</hi> however ſingly in the letter, ſo inferiour thereunto, that

            <p>By all theſe ſignificant types, and figures, did God feed the faith of true ſaints, under the Law, who ſaw to the end of that miniſtration, which was ſuitable to that non-age of the world, their lot was fallen in, as alſo to the changable nature of firſt-covenant-life, in the higheſt diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. Thus, <hi>ſeeing the end of all that vvas to be abolished,</hi> were they, in the right uſe thereof, pointed unto Chriſt, both in his inviſible Angelical ſtate of reſurrection-lamb, living in his root; and alſo, as to deſcend out of that, into a viſibility, and ſo, to come forth in our glorified nature.

Men, at higheſt, in holy fleſh, righteouſnes of man (with evil Angels, in their natural excellencies) are the worſt ſort of ſcoffers, that will be found, in the laſt dayes, againſt this viſible kingdom of Chriſt, on earth; and, that, in a ſelf-condemning light; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4.

As to manifeſtation, that which is natural, was firſt, in Chriſt's perſon. Chriſt the branch, in his inviſible ſtate, was the <hi>firſt-born</hi> natural-Spirit, before <hi>the firſt begotten from the dead,</hi> the Reſurrection Lamb, in a ſpiritual, new-creation life. The originally unchangable creature-ſpirit of Chriſt, was the High-Prieſt, that ſacrificed the ſaid firſt-born, and ſo, raiſed it into its own twofold new-creation life, the original <hi>nevv heaven and nevv

               </gap> ſpiritual ſtate, which, alwayes, according to God's wiſe method, was to follow.

               </gap> of all things, in both; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. But, though Chriſt thus laid a ſure Foundation of bleſſedneſs for thoſe <hi>vvhoſe names vvere vvritten in his</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection-<hi>book of Life</hi> (inaſmuch, as their perſons, comprehended in his death, would yield up nature to death, in like obedience, with him) yet, many angels and men, do finally refuſe, through inordinate love to the life of nature, to exchange their natural for his ſpiritual State. So, do they keep up their natural ſtate, as a wall of partition between them and God's ſpiritual, in which alone, true bleſſednes can be found. Since the fall, all mankind have an inherent ſeed of enmity in them, to God, Chriſt, and his ſpiritual Life. This enmity, in the evil angels, by whom ſown in men, is unchangable and incurable: In man, barely as a conſequent of the firſt ſin, not ſo. But, this diſeaſe in man, till cured by ſuch obedience to the Croſs, as was at firſt refuſed, is an infectious leproſie in him, and becoms as mortal and incurable in him, as in the evil angels, when found guilty, on the like perſonal account, with our firſt parents. By the purifying fire of the Croſs alone, can the enmity contracted by the fall, be melted down, or that obedience performed, which alwayes was the duty of the firſt-creation, ſpirit, in man or angel, before their fall, in order to their eſtabliſhment in a ſpiritual ſtate of everlaſting bleſſedneſs. The diſobedience of man and angel has made no change in God's proceedings, as to the death of the natural, in order to a ſpiritual life; but has rendred man's ſuffering part, under the Croſs, much more hard and difficult, through an actual enmity, and ſtruggling, contrary mind, thereunto, ſet up in him, by the Devil. But, in this hard work, the over-ruling providence of God
<pb facs="tcp:34311:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> makes the utmoſt malice of viſible and inviſible enemies, ſerviceable to the bruiſing the ſaints heel, or crucifying his natural man, which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for his receiving that ſpiritual life, in which, to break the enemies head. The allotted time for the compleating this work of patience, on the whole ſpiritual body of Chriſt, is the ſaints ſuffering Seaſon; on the finiſhing whereof, they are all, to enter into a ſtate of everlaſting reſt and bleſſedneſs. And, this is the ground of Gods pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience towards all ſorts of wilful enemies of himſelf and ſaints, during the time, the Prince and Power of the Air, is permitted, in anſwer to his own deſire, to have the active, ruling power, in and over the natural ſtate and principle, which, in greateſt love, God has abſolutly denied to Chriſt and his ſaints. So has God curſed this earthly ſtate or firſt-creation life (at beſt, and in the moſt excellent part thereof) that if ſaints, in their love, are found running out, after the ſame, they meet with nothing but myſtical Briars and Thorns, therein. For this cauſe, till the work of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, or, ſuffering, be accompliſhed on the whole body of ſaints, Chriſt is content to remain paſſive and ſilent, though in his own perſon, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of that irreſiſtible power, in heaven, <hi>his far countre,</hi> in which he ſits, <hi>laughing</hi> all <hi>his enemies to ſcorn, looking dovvn,</hi> in a holy contempt, <hi>upon them,</hi> from his heavenly place. And, he over-rules, all along this world, all oppoſition of viſible or inviſible enemies, in a direct contrariety to their own deſigns, to make them inſtrumental to his, by removing out of his Saints, what let's and hinders the ſetting up of his Kingdom, in and with them, viſibly on the earth. Chriſt makes all, that enemies do againſt him and his ſaints, in his paſſive, and the enemies active ſeaſon, a preparative to his and his ſaints active ſeaſon, in his viſible kingdom, and to the dreadful paſſive ſeaſon of all their enemies, for evermore.</p>
            <p>Hence is it, that the paſſive ſeaſon of Chriſt, and active power of the Devil and World, in perverted firſt-creation Principles, whilſt in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect contrariety, as to deſign, hold exact proportion, as to time, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ending together. And, <hi>at the time of the end,</hi> will be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt's wonder-working power, that, all along the ſaid active ſeaſon, of world and devil, and paſſive ſeaſon of Chriſt and Saints, has made ſerviceable to his own deſigns, the moſt oppoſite purpoſes and actings of implacable enemies, rendring all exactly conducible to the ſetting up of his ſpiritual kingdom, over all, in a reſurrection life <hi>and glory, never to be done avvay.</hi> By his viſibility herein, will he period the active power of the Devil.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:34311:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>This then, may ſerve for anſwer to the preſent queſtion, as cleerly demonſtrating the reaſon of Chriſt's ſo long deferring his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and active ſeaſon. And, hence, is there no ground, from ſuch delay, to doubt the certainty of his viſible ſpiritual comming. For, all along, has Chriſt kept cloſs to the wiſe and holy orders, by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, at firſt, for giving a day of manifeſtation, firſt, to that which is natural; reſerving that which is ſpiritual, to the laſt. The Devils beſt time is firſt, his worſt, laſt, and that, for ever. And, though permitted to make a ſeeming interruption to Chriſts exerciſe of his reigning pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, all along this world; Yet, ſo far has he been, thereby, from diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the deſigns of God, for revealing his ſpiritual and everlaſting ſtate of truth (and ſo, for the ſetting up Chriſts viſible kingdom therein) that, all his oppoſition to the ſame, has been made ſerviceable thereunto, even to the active reigning power and kingdom of Chriſt and his ſaints. The Praiſe of all is to be aſcribed to the marveilous and unſearchable wiſdom of God, which has made the moſt contrary appearances, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſerviceable hereunto. And, in theſe myſterious workings, has the wiſdom of God, not been altogether undiſcerned by ſpiritual ſaints, under every diſpenſation. This has quieted, and ſupported them, in the blackeſt hours of oppoſition from World and Devil. They have ſeen all, by the over-ruling influences of Chriſt, uſeful for the carying on of his deſigns of grace and peace, to them.</p>
            <p>But, the diſcerning and teſtimony, had and given by ſaints, before and under the Law, as to the viſibility of Chriſt's ſpiritual kingdom, at his ſecond comming, was greatly ſtrengthened and heightened, as given in Chriſt's own perſon; becauſe till then, <hi>the ſpirit</hi> of Truth, <hi>vvas not,</hi> by actual participation, <hi>given, till our nature in him vvas glorified;</hi> Joh. 7. 39. Then did he poure down of his glorified humane ſpirit, on ſaints, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. which diſtinguiſhed them from ſpiritual believers under the Law. He was pointed out in his reſurrection-life, to them, under the Law, in types and figures, as to be revealed in the very thing it ſelf, under another, ſucceeding diſpenſation. Yet, from a powerful ſpiritual faith therein, were ſaints under the Law, not only clear and ſtrong in their teſtimony to the ſaid ſpiritual ſtate, and viſible kingdom of Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but, by that faith, received a ſatisfying demonſtration of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, and embraced the ſubſtance of thoſe things they waited for. They had the undoubted evidence of things, then unſeen, as to actual manifeſtation. They ſaw and knew, they ſhould actually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34311:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the ſame Reſurrection-Spirit and Life of Chriſt, at the apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time for the pouring out thereof, from our glorified Nature, in Chriſt's perſon. And, their Spiritual Faith herein, had a powerful, transforming operation upon their natural Man, in that Law-day, and before. Yet is the difference of the Law, from the Goſpel-Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, very great. For, by the latter, have we the glad tydings of the viſible gifts of that Spirit, which was waited for; and, by Faith only, laid hold upon, under the former. And, this begets a new and more excellent ſort of Spiritual Faith, or diſcerning, in Goſpel-Saints, through Chriſt's actually ſetting up in them, his revealed and communicated Reſurrection-Life, and Glory, which former Saints waited for. <hi>Believers,</hi> under the Goſpel-miniſtration, <hi>receive the</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>end of that Faith,</hi> under the Law, <hi>even the Spirit of Adoption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they cry, Abba, Father.</hi> The firſt heavenly rain or ſhower of Chriſt's new-creature Spirit, we find an account of <hi>(Act.</hi> 2.) on the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and other primitive Saints, of the Goſpel-day, as the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that <hi>Promiſe of the Father,</hi> which, between his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, <hi>he commanded them to wait for, from him,</hi> Luk. 24. 49. Act. 1. 4. By this firſt pouring forth of the Holy Ghoſt or new-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Spirit of Chriſt, upon them, did he inſtitute the Goſpel-diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, in diſtinction from that of the Law. And, hereby, were the Saints of that day, much more eminently, then ever before, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to give a clear and full witneſs to this Spiritual State of Truth, as actual partakers of that glorified Spirit of Chriſt, which, till then, had never bin ſo given, or received. So, the diſpenſation, under which, given, muſt be more Spiritual, than any former Saints were under. The leaſt, under this diſpenſation, is greater and under higher priviledges, than the greateſt, under the Law-miniſtration. The firſt Goſpel-ſhower gave the World a ſignal taſte of this great mercy, by which, to expect <hi>the latter rain, of the ſame</hi> Spirit, which will be far greater and more general, on the Spiritual Seed in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the fore-running diſpenſation to Chriſt's ſecond perſonal coming, in the full bleſſing of the everlaſting Goſpel, the joyful news of Chriſt's near approaching Spiritual Kingdom, <hi>which ſhall be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the World, and then comes the end;</hi> Mat. 24. 14. The very Apoſtles, while Chriſt was with them, in the Fleſh, and, after his Reſurrection, alſo, when ſpeaking to them of this great thing (the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible Seed of Spiritual Life, not yet quickned up in them)
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34311:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> were altogether ignorant of the Spiritual nature of his viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet to come, and of that Spirit and Life, in which it will be managed. According to appointment, were they aſſembled on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> waiting for the Holy Ghoſt, that Spirit, in which Chriſt's Kingdom is to be managed. That day, under the Law, was a commanded feaſt of firſt fruits, reaped in the Typical Land of Promiſe. This type ſignificantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the myſtical truth or ſubſtance, the firſt fruits of the true Land of Promiſe, or Chriſt's riſen Spirit, brought forth in, and by Saints. <hi>This Spirit came upon them, as a ſound from Heaven, of a ruſhing mighty wind, and ſate upon each of them, as cloven Tongues, like Fire.</hi> So, <hi>they ſpake with other Tongues, words which the Holy Ghoſt taught them, as that Spirit gave them utterance.</hi> Theſe other Tongues, were <hi>the new Tongues, Chriſt promiſed them, they ſhould ſpeak with,</hi> Mar. 16. 17. The new-creature-Spirit of Chriſt, partaken of, by Saints, becomes another, or new Tongue in them, diſtinct from and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to any Tongue, thoughts, or words, found in their natural Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. This new Tongue, both from its own nature, and operation of it, on the natural Spirit of the Saint, may fitly be typed out, by a viſible <hi>cloven,</hi> or twofold <hi>fiery Tongue.</hi> Firſt, From its own nature, as conſiſting, in Chriſt's perſon (the true original thereof) of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Reſurrection-ſtate and building, inſeparably united, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from each other. Secondly, From its twofold ſecret, inviſible operation upon man, transforming, yet not burning or conſuming him, by its fire-baptiſm upon him. It empties him of all his change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life and wealth, unmakes, and builds him anew, and fill's him with its newneſs of Life, and true riches. And, as in Chriſt, ſo, in his peculiar ſpouſal Saints (capacitated by their double portion of Chriſt's twofold Reſurrection-Life, to receive the double viſion of the divine Glory) are the twofold ſpiritual Principles of Chriſt's new-creature-nature, fitly repreſented by <hi>cloven Tongues, as Fire.</hi> The inferiour, earthly glorified Saint, of the ſingle portion, in ſpiritual, reſurrection-life, as found in unchangeable harmony with thoſe of the double, may, both, and altogether, be fitly ſignified by <hi>cloven Tongues of Fire,</hi> as diſtinct from each other, and yet, inſeparably join'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Holy Ghoſt, that deſcended upon the Apoſtles, is that new-creature-Spirit, which, in Chriſt, lives in perſonal union with the Divinity, in both parts thereof, upper and lower, or moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34311:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> and glorified earthly, all ſpiritual, and above the firſt-creation-building or natural ſtate of Angel or Man, at beſt, as far as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Heaven is above the Earth. No wonder, then, if the effects of this Spirit, poured down on the Apoſtles, were amazing to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural obſervers thereof. For, as a figure of this commanding Tongue, or new-creature Spirit, could they make themſelves under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by all their hearers, of whatever differing languages. By this litteral miracle, was given an undeniable demonſtration of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive nature, and univerſal knowledg of this new Tongue or Spirit, including all ſpiritual, both heavenly and earthly-glorified wiſdom, and knowledg, and alſo comprehending all ſingle natural knowledg, in it ſelf. Hence, fitly ſaid to know, ſee, or <hi>judg all things; 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 15. This new-creation-tongue, that could make itſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by all, in that primitive Goſpel-day, was a type of the powerful miniſtration of the Goſpel, <hi>in the laſt days,</hi> under <hi>the latter rain,</hi> or pouring down <hi>of the</hi> ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> or new-creature Tongue, in a viſibility and diſcernableneſs to all, ſo as to command its acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment from all hearers thereof, through its ſuitable ſound or voice, to every one's underſtanding; and irreſiſtible demonſtration of its intrinſick excellency, to all hearts. The wonderful effects of its firſt ſhowring down, were, that the receivers thereof, did work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, caſt out Devils, and healed all ſorts of Diſeaſes, litteral and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. This precious myſtical <hi>balm of Gilead,</hi> became, in them, a powerful antidote againſt all inward and outward Poiſon; <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 17, 18. They could, thereby, not only diſcern, but cure all diſeaſes of Spirit as well as Body. Yea, a union, by Faith, with this Spirit, under the Law, was of ſuch power, that <hi>Eliſha,</hi> at a great diſtance, was able to diſcern and declare the ſecret deſigns of God's and his People's Enemies, and to cure diſeaſes, ſpiritual as well as bodily, as in <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian.</hi> He, not only, by his counſel, cleans'd him from his bodily Leproſy, but (as ſeems implied, by bidding him, <hi>go in peace,</hi> and Chriſt's owning his coming to a ſpiritual Prophet, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to the Jews, for rejecting his ſpiritual miniſtry and goſpel-doctrine; <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 27.) of the enmity of his Spirit, by an effectual faith in the new-creation name of the true Son of Peace. He was able alſo to diſcern the inward diſeaſe of enmity, in <hi>Gehazi,</hi> to be mortal, and incurable, as was figured by the outward Leproſy, which was curea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>Naaman,</hi> but, rendred unchangeable in him and his unbelieving
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34311:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> Seed, forever; 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 27. And, by the like new-creature power of ſpiritual Faith, did he raiſe the Widow's Son, from bodily death; typing forth the like power of raiſing the natural Spirit out of its ſtate of enmity and death. All this, as fore-running types of what was fulfill'd on the natural ſpirit of Saints, by the firſt Goſpel-rain of Chriſt's riſen Spirit upon them. And, this yet, was but a type of the more abundant effects of <hi>the latter rain</hi> of the ſame Spirit, <hi>in the last days.</hi> Under that firſt rain, were they impowred to find out and cure both bodily and ſpiritual diſeaſes, by <hi>forgiving all Sins,</hi> that were of a pardonable nature; <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23. But, under <hi>the former or latter rain,</hi> are Saints not to aſſume any thing to themſelves, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe all to the new-creation power of their Lord and Head; <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 12,—16. To him, muſt they ever own and pay their ſubjection, though in marriage union with him, by partaking of his Spirit. Nor does the Saint, by ſurrender of his will and life, to Chriſt, in order to live in his will and Spirit, any more loſe his diſtinct perſonality from Chriſt's, than the diſtinction of ſexes is loſt, in the litteral marriage-union of man and woman. The Saint, by union with Chriſt, lives wholly in his will, at laſt, and ſo, is poſſeſs'd of his power and riches. <hi>Whatever he asks in that</hi> will, new <hi>name,</hi> or life <hi>of Chriſt, is given him. Joh.</hi> 16. 23. This Spirit qualified Saints (above all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing words and thoughts of man's or Angel's natural wiſdom, that's but <hi>vain Philoſophy)</hi> for their diſtinct reſpective Offices in the Goſpel-Church, as <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Teachers, &amp;c.</hi> By the diverſity of <hi>the gifts and operations</hi> thereof, was every of them fitted for their diſtinct Offices, in the aſſemblies of Saints; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4,—11. They were, thereby, enabled; rightly to diſcern and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all things, according to the mind of Chriſt; And, hereby, did they gain Love, from thoſe that believed; and fear, from thoſe that would oppoſe them. The powerful preſence of the riſen Spirit of Chriſt, fitted them for the marvellous converſion of believers, and <hi>ſtopping the mouth's of gainſayers; None were able to withſtand the</hi> power and <hi>wiſdom of that Spirit,</hi> they came forth, in; <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 10. Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were converted by <hi>Peters</hi> firſt Sermon, in it. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41. They could, alſo, find out diſeaſes of body and mind, and diſcern whether they were mortal and incurable, or not; and, accordingly declare or pronounce Sentence. <hi>Ananias and Saphira</hi> pretended a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the believers of that day, for ſelling all their poſſeſſions,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34311:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> and bringing the price thereof, for the good of the community, <hi>Peter,</hi> in the power of the Spirit of Chriſt, found out their ſecret crafty agreement, for <hi>keeping back part of the price;</hi> And, he was able in ſuch an irreſiſtible, convincing manner, to detect and ſet home the guilt thereof, upon their hearts and conſciences, as became an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate execution as well as ſentence of death, upon them; <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 1,—10. From the ſeverity of the puniſhment (for ſuffering their hearts to be fill'd with Satan, the Father of Lies, ſo as to lye to the Holy Ghoſt, or infallible Spirit of truth) may it appear, they were guilty of the ſame Sin, ſpiritually as well as litterally underſtood. The litteral was a type of the Spiritual, even of that which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable fault in any, the keeping back any part of the myſtical riches and life of the natural Spirit, at beſt. For, this is a lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the convincing diſcoveries of the Holy Ghoſt, that declares and requires all to be ſurrendred to Death, in ſacrifice to God, as his due, and their duty. And they, under pretence of all, bring but a part, and lay it down at Chriſt's Feet, as the whole. This rendred them (and ſo, any others, found in the like practice) guilty of the like <hi>witchcraft and rebellion, with Saul,</hi> in laying down, only the refuſe-things and luſts of the corrupt ſpirit of nature, for ſacrifice, but, keeping the beſt, the righteous firſt-covenant-life, with the riches, fruitfulneſs and glory thereof, as, therein, fitted <hi>Prieſts, to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God.</hi> All this, they know, God requires, in ſacrifice, as <hi>Saul</hi> acknowledg'd, in letter; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 21. The ſpiritual Law of the Croſs requires the beſt things, in nature, for ſacrifice. All is to be laid at Chriſt's feet, the true <hi>Melchiſedec and Prieſt of the moſt high God,</hi> and, in the death, not life thereof, to be offered up, in ſacrifice, to God. When any (clearly convinced of their duty, as to <hi>the whole-burnt-offering,</hi> which their natural Spirit, in the utmoſt firſt-covenant righteouſneſs, wiſdom, life and glory, is to be) do bring but a part, and pretend that to be the whole ſacrifice, God requires of them, <hi>they do, wilfully and knowingly, lye againſt the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and are found in a wilful conſpiracy with <hi>the Father of Lies, who has filled their heart.</hi> In this Sin, ſhall <hi>hypocritical Sinners in Sion,</hi> pretenders only to Goſpel, and Spiritual Saintſhip, be diſcerned, and, thereupon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and ſentenced to death, by the Spirit of Chriſt, in his Saints, in the latter days, much more eminently and frequently than in the primitive Goſpel-times. The declaring of this ſort of ſpiritual guilt,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34311:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> will ſo powerfully ſtir up and awaken the condemning conviction thereof, as to cauſe a ſpiritual death on all ſuch wilful <hi>Lyars againſt the Holy Ghost.</hi> By the convincing light of it, are they, at once, ſhewed the fading nature of all their firſt-creation-life and treaſure, and the unchangeable nature and excellency of the ſecond. After all this, to prefer the former, in hatred and deſpiteful oppoſition to the latter, is unexcuſable and unpardonable. Such <hi>blaſpheming the Holy Ghost,</hi> or thinking and ſpeaking evilly and contemptibly of it, as a wicked Spirit, <hi>a Devil</hi> (as the righteous firſt-covenant Jews call'd it, in Chriſt's perſon) is <hi>a Sin not to be prayed for.</hi> Nor Chriſt, nor Saints will intercede on behalf of ſuch as are known guilty thereof; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16. God will not have any pray, for what he will never grant, the pardon of what he will never pardon. The Jews called that creature-ſpirit of Chriſt, that lives in unchangeable union with the divine, the Devil. Saints, inſtead of praying for ſuch, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred, in the primitive Goſpel-Church, in harmony of mind with God himſelf, to pronounce a juſt ſentence of death, upon them. Such ſignal honour was conferred upon them, in the firſt inſtitution of the Goſpel-miniſtry. And this was a ſpiritual and eternal excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of them, <hi>the Anathema Maran-atha (1 Cor.</hi> 16. 22.) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mortal and incureable nature of their diſeaſe and guilt. Where the ſpiritual diſeaſe was not mortal, but cureable, the excommunication was but temporary, for their cure, by <hi>deſtruction of their Fleſh,</hi> or natural Spirit, <hi>in order to their Salvation</hi> in Chriſt's Spirit of everlaſting righteouſneſs and truth. So, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, with his Father's Wife, ſpiritually underſtood, was a temporary joining (through the ſtrength of temptation, and his own weakneſs) with the evil angelical nature, which, in the innocency thereof, was the higheſt natural, firſt-covenant ſpouſe of Chriſt (the Parent of Angels and Men, Father of Spirits) in a ſuperiority to humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in firſt-creation life, at beſt. The Evil Angels did, at firſt, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe lewdneſs among themſelves, in that firſt-covenant-ſtate, againſt Chriſt, in the ſecond. And men, from their firſt ſin and fall, have been committing the like ſpiritual Fornication, under their conduct, and by their example. Spiritual Saints could (in the alſearching ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt) find out ſuch ſpiritual diſeaſes, and judg, whether mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and incurable, or not, ſo accordingly dealt with thoſe that were guilty. <hi>The</hi> Goſpel-<hi>Church, aſſembled in the</hi> new-creation <hi>name</hi> or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34311:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> Spirit <hi>of Chriſt, did, in that power of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> pronounce ſuch an excommunication on that inceſtuous perſon, a member of their Church, as was called <hi>a delivering of him up to Satan.</hi> Yet, was this but a temporary puniſhment, expoſing him to the furious buffetings of the Devil, as a means to procure his recovery and laſting health. For, by the power of this new name of Jeſus, put forth upon him, was he recovered as a brand out of the Fire, by the powerful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming his natural deſire, through the operation of the Croſs, in which Satan himſelf was made uſe of, as in <hi>Job's</hi> and other Saints caſes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this wonderful manner, were the firſt Goſpel-Miniſters fitted to diſcharge their Office, in all reſpects, towards that <hi>flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt had made them overſeers;</hi> both for miniſtring ſpiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to them; and, healing ſpiritual, as well as litteral diſeaſes, in them. A power, had they, ſuitable to theſe great ends. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the practiſe of the ordinance of Baptiſm, did, in the power of Chriſt's new name, and Spirit, <hi>baptize with the Holy Ghost, certain Diſciples at Epheſus, who,</hi> as yet, <hi>knew not whether there were a Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or ſuch a diſpenſation of the Spirit of Chriſt, diſtinct from the waſh'd, renew'd natural Spirit, the effect of <hi>John's</hi> baptiſm and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; <hi>Act. 19. 1,—5. Paul baptized them in the name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> that is, into a true acknowledgment and experience of his new-creation-life and Spirit. So, in that other inſtitution, <hi>the laying on of Hands</hi> (ver. 6.) <hi>was the Holy Ghost</hi> actually <hi>given them.</hi> On this, ſuch new Goſpel-Believers, immediately <hi>ſpake with new Tongues, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied.</hi> So, that other ordinance or inſtitution, for <hi>anointing the ſick,</hi> was practiſed by them, with like ſucceſs, at that time. <hi>The El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the</hi> Goſpel-Church <hi>anointed ſuch,</hi> with the new name of Chriſt, as the ſoveraign cure for ſpiritual and bodily diſeaſes; <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 14, 15. Thoſe ſpiritual, teaching, apoſtolical-elders, who were the higheſt Order in the new Goſpel-Church, by their powerful prayer of Faith, in the name or ſpirit of Chriſt, did actually cure the ſick, <hi>ſtrengthen the weak hands and feeble knees</hi> of faulty ſpiritual-ſaints.</p>
            <p>Thus, have we ſeen the power and ſpirituality of the goſpel-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, beyond that of the Law; by the actual diſpenſing of that Spirit, which was only witneſſed by faith, under the Law: But, brought into ſight, under the Goſpel. Goſpel-Saints then, are thankfully to receive the convincing diſcoveries hereof, by ſpiritual light; and to ſhew themſelves willing and ready, on any terms, to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34311:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> enter into the promiſed (yea, ſhew'd and offered) new-creation-Land or ſtate of Life, by perſonal union with Chriſt in his heavenly or glorified earthly ſpirit, which will prove ſuch a ſtate of bleſſedneſs, <hi>the gates of hell, all the powers of darkneſs can never prevail against,</hi> or diſanul. But, on the contrary, ſuch as evilly entreat Chriſt's myſtical Spies (the ſpiritual diſcoveries, ſights and taſts of his Reſurrection-life, given, in conviction, ſuited to their natural ſpirit) ſo as wilfully to reject them, and diſcover and betray them to the enemy, the Devil (joining with him to mock at, and do deſpite thereunto) <hi>God will ſwear in his wrath they ſhall never enter into his reſt,</hi> that new-creation-land or ſtate of life, by them, finally refuſed, and contemned. The ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual light, as a ſpirit of prophecy, given to them, received and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by them, for a ſeaſon, <hi>Saul</hi>'s caſe, (by which they ſee the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of accepting God's offered ſpirit of Grace, on his declared terms) ſhall depart from them, and in the room thereof, <hi>an evil</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical <hi>Spirit</hi> (with the higheſt deceitful light) <hi>ſhall enter into them.</hi> And, thence-forward, will they expreſs implacable enmity againſt the ſpiritual <hi>David</hi>'s, Chriſt, and his Saints. Thus, the Goſpel-miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and light, received as a temporary bleſſing, and the Goſpel-Life, or eternal bleſſing thereof, wilfully rejected, that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary bleſſing is turned into an everlaſting curſe and judgment, on them. Bare ſpiritual light then, which makes a ſpiritualized natural underſtanding, is no ground of a firm rejoycing, though, for a ſeaſon, they be enabled thereby, <hi>to cast out Devils,</hi> or obtain a victory over the corrupt ſpirit of nature, brought into, and inſtigated in Men, by the Devil. This, Chriſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to <hi>the ſeventy diſciples; Luk.</hi> 10. 17,—20. All ſpiritual light may be withdrawn, if the life, thereby ſhew'd and offered, be hated and rejected. And then, the evil Angel or Spirit enters, with its coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit imitation of the true Spirit of propheſy, as into <hi>Saul,</hi> which did preſently excite in him, an enraged malice <hi>against David, becauſe he ſaw the Lord was with him; 1 Sam.</hi> 18. 10,—12. Till then we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience a change of principle and life, from natural to ſpiritual, by which infallibly to ſee and know <hi>our names written in Heaven,</hi> Chriſt's new-creature-<hi>book of Life,</hi> we have no firm ground of ſpiritual joy. <hi>The unſpeakable gift of the Spirit</hi> of truth itſelf, is the full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promiſe to Saints, under the Law. <hi>Jeremy</hi> and other Saints were ſhewed the means and ſeaſon for this Goſpel-gift, as the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34311:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>new thing</hi> and wonder <hi>to be done in the Earth</hi> of our fleſhly nature, in Chriſt's perſon. It is expreſſed by <hi>a Womans compaſſing a Man; Jer.</hi> 31. 22. This was fulfilled, in letter, by the Virgin's compaſſing, or containing in her, the holy Thing, begotten and <hi>conceived by the Holy Ghost,</hi> or new-creature Spirit of Chriſt, the builder of its own viſible houſe, in our nature. But the myſtical and principal mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was; the natural Spirit of Man, figured by the Woman, in Chriſt, did compaſs or contain in it, a holy ſeed of his new-creature-ſpirit of truth, and by the death thereof, brought forth the new-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation man-child, which received its firſt viſibility, in and through the earth of our glorified nature, in him. This new man-child-ſpirit, or principle of life, till thus manifeſted, lay, as <hi>a mystery, hid in God,</hi> not diſcerned by Angel or Man, but through Faith. And, ſo had it remained for ever, had not <hi>the Son of Man in Heaven,</hi> from everlaſting, prepared this natural capacity in himſelf, for partaking of our fleſhly nature, and by the death and glorification thereof, become the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarer of his own inviſible man-child-Life and Spirit. The natural Man of Chriſt, that was to paſs through a myſtical child-bearing and death, was <hi>the Woman</hi> (and ſo, in Saints) ſhewed <hi>John (Rev.</hi> 12.) who was <hi>with Child, and travelling in pain, cried out to be delivered.</hi> This was effected by ſuch a pure ſubjection of Chriſt's natural to his ſpiritual man, that <hi>he was</hi> pained and <hi>straitned, till the fire-baptiſm had accompliſh'd</hi> the death of the former, on which, the new-creation-life of the latter, might ſhine forth, in, and through it. And, this did he, in a publick capacity, as the means to obtain a birth of new-creation-life for the whole ſpiritual ſeed of his heavenly and glorified earthly Family. On their behalf, <hi>John</hi> heard a ſound of <hi>joy in Heaven,</hi> for the victory thus obtain'd for them, by Chriſt, in our nature, as the only means for their obtaining the ſame victory, and bleſſedneſs, with him. <hi>Now is come Salvation and Strength (ver.</hi> 10.) to the whole new-creature ſeed-royal, by the death of that ſtate in Chriſt, the old Serpent is a Prince and Ruler, in. Thus, did Chriſt handle our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in himſelf (as his Followers are to do, in themſelves) and by ſuch Death, overcame all enemies. This Chriſt did in our nature, as a declaratory repetition of the firſt battel in Heaven, fought by <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, againſt the Dragon and his; <hi>ver.</hi> 7. Chriſt, as a Reſurrection-Lamb, and his good Angels (that, with him, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and exchanged their changeable firſt-creation-life, for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34311:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſecond) beat the Devil and his Angels, who did, rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ſet up for themſelves in the firſt, againſt God, Chriſt and <hi>his Angels, that</hi> obediently <hi>followed their head, into the</hi> life of <hi>the ſecond; Ezek. 1. 20. &amp;</hi> 10. 11. This twofold Victory, obtain'd by Chriſt (in the reſurrection-ſtate of his inviſible, angelical nature, <hi>before the foundation of the World;</hi> and, ſince, in our glorified humane nature) makes up <hi>the glad tidings of the Goſpel</hi>-ſtate of Chriſt, in his conquering man-child-ſpirit, the leading witneſſes whereof, were extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily qualified, by the firſt ſhower of it, to become <hi>more than Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</hi> The way of their Conqueſt, was, by ſuffering. This is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Weapon, by which the Lord and Servant were both to fight this ſpiritual battel. By ſteddily enduring all ſorts of oppoſitions and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, they became triumphant overcomers. All the perſecutions, primitive Goſpel-Saints met with, in and for their witneſſing ſervice, tended only to the working out thoſe <hi>marks of the dying of the Lord Jeſus, in their mortal Fleſh,</hi> that were matter of rejoycing to their immortal Spirits. All <hi>the ſorrow</hi> of their natural man, outward or inward, was ſoon forgotten, <hi>for joy, the</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Man-Child was born,</hi> in them. This man-child-ſpirit was the myſtical <hi>Reed, like a Rod, given John,</hi> to diſtinguiſh <hi>the inner from the outer Court, and</hi> according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>to meaſure the Temple of God, the Altar, and them that worſhip there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> This work could be done by no other Reed, ſave the glorified Spirit of Jeſus, fitted for diſcerning or judging (in harmony with the divine and new-creature mind of Chriſt) between the firſt and ſecond creation-ſpirit, as alſo between the twofold diſtinct branches, of the new-creature-ſpirit, or building, in Chriſt, and of the differing ranks and orders of Saints, belonging thereunto, who will find their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive places and portions in the viſion and enjoyment of the divine Glory. This high priviledg, through the ſpiritual mind and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord, thus ſet up in the Saint, <hi>Paul</hi> eſteemed, of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable a value, as, in compariſon thereof, to make no account of his own or others, natural judgment, in the higheſt and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate exerciſe of it; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. The new-creature-building, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, in Chriſt's perſon, and glorified manhood, conſiſts of two parts, or principles, heavenly and earthly glorified. The full aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe, renders any one Saint, or more, Chriſt's twofold, or two witneſſes, as declaring the comprehenſive fulneſs of his new-creature-Spirit. Though <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a figure of Chriſt, was the Parent of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34311:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> a twofold ſeed, or firſt and ſecond covenant <hi>Jew;</hi> he was alſo, in a farther ſenſe, a figure of him, as Parent of a twofold ſpiritual, new-creature ſeed, his heavenly and earthly glorified members, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental witneſſes of the twofold principles of his new-creature build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This myſtery was frequently repreſented, by types and ſhadows, to the faith of ſpiritual Saints, under the Law: but, the diſtinction, and inſeparable union of theſe two parts of Chriſt's comprehenſive creature-nature, received their firſt viſibility in Chriſt's glorified hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. By this, the (before) inviſible <hi>temple of God, was opened;</hi> and the firſt ſhower of his riſen Spirit, ſent down, on Goſpel-Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which qualified them (by a ſingle or double portion, in the twofold parts of the new-creation-building) to be <hi>his two witneſſes.</hi> Such are aſſigned their diſtinct witneſſing-work, according to <hi>John</hi>'s viſion <hi>(Rev.</hi> 11.) as members of his heavenly or earthly glorified body. Theſe two ſorts of witneſſes of Chriſt's ſpiritual life, as all joined together, declare and make up the fulneſs of his creature-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as members of his myſtical, ſpiritual body. This twofold new-creature principle, in Chriſt and Saints, was lively figured out, in the requeſt for <hi>the two Sons of Zebedee, by their Mother,</hi> who was a figure of Chriſt, our ſpiritual Parent, in his deſire to his Father; to wit, <hi>that his two</hi> ſorts of witneſſing <hi>Sons</hi> or Saints, <hi>may ſit on his right and left hand,</hi> in an everlaſting fruition of his divine glory. And, theſe are <hi>the two</hi> ſpiritual <hi>anointed ones, Olive-trees</hi> or <hi>Sons of Oil,</hi> placed <hi>on each ſide of Chriſt, the Lord of the whole Earth; Zech. 4. 3. &amp; 14. Rev. 11. 4. John</hi> alſo ſaw a <hi>Sack-cloath-state, theſe two witneſſes would be brought into,</hi> notwithſtanding their firſt eminent viſibility, in the power, and under the ſtrong and clear Sunſhine of the ſpiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, amongſt them. And, this dark ſeaſon of their <hi>Sack-cloath prophecy,</hi> muſt, <hi>in faith and patience,</hi> be paſſed thorow, by them; and, the viſibility of their ſpiritual ſtate be taken or withdrawn from them. All this ſeems figured out to <hi>John,</hi> by that <hi>Woman, clothed with the Sun, having the Moon under her Feet; Rev.</hi> 12. 1. Hereby, is repreſented, Firſt, the birth of the conquering man-child ſpirit, in Chriſt's perſon: Secondly, the powerful witneſs of it, in and by his ſpiritual members. Then, <hi>John ſaw this man-child caught up from the Woman,</hi> or Church, <hi>to God, and to his Throne.</hi> And, on the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing this man-child-ſpirit from the Woman, or crucified mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, is ſhe commanded <hi>into the Wilderneſs,</hi> as <hi>the prepared
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34311:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> place for her, where, to remain,</hi> by God's appointment, 1260 <hi>days</hi> or years, the allotted time for their ſack-cloth prophecy. During this ſack-cloth ſtate of his Church on Earth, Chriſt takes care for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing their inward Man, by inviſibly feeding that, from his own Spirit, with <hi>his hidden</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Manna,</hi> through ſuch angelical viſits, as their own natural underſtanding may be little ſenſible of. This <hi>Wilderneſs</hi>-ſtate, and <hi>Sack-cloth prophecy,</hi> therein, is a peculiar diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Croſs, ſuited to the time of the man-child-ſpirits abſence, as to any viſibility thereof. During this ſeaſon, the Woman (ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Saints, in their crucified natural man) <hi>is ſhut up,</hi> as <hi>in a ſecret Chamber,</hi> or <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> in which, ſecured from any dangerous or hurtful aſſaults, by World or Devil; and is, therein, by Faith, chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and quietly to wait for the return of her ſpiritual Lord and Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, in the viſible glory of his man-child, ſpiritual life and ſtate. Then, <hi>John</hi> ſaw, alſo the means, by which, this myſtical Woman, or Spouſe of Chriſt, was to be carried into the Wilderneſs, as her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared place or ſtate of ſafety. <hi>Two wings of a great Eagle were given her,</hi> by which, <hi>to flee into the</hi> ſaid <hi>Wilderneſs</hi>-ſtate, out of the reach of any hurt, by the utmoſt expreſſions of her inward or outward ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies malice, which would certainly be <hi>ſent after her as a flood; ver.</hi> 14, 15. The great Eagle, by whoſe wings ſhe is carried into this place of ſecurity, is the perſon of Chriſt, as head to his new-creature Saints, by making his own natural ſpirit or ſtate, under the croſs, that dead <hi>carkaſs, to which they are gathered; (Mat.</hi> 24. 24.) in a conformity to him, by the like death of nature in them, in order to receive his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, ſpiritual, new-creation-life. This, by a fixed faith in the two diſtinct principles of his new-creature-Spirit, <hi>the two wings of that</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Eagle,</hi> by which they are ſafely carried and guided into the wilderneſs-ſtate of their crucified natural man, under the Croſs. By theſe wings, is the inward man of Chriſt's myſtical dead body, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, kept in perfect ſafety (and inviſibly nouriſh'd <hi>for a time, times, and half a time) from the</hi> hurtful fury of the <hi>Serpent.</hi> The ſack-cloth prophecy, then, is dated from the Woman's actual flight into the Wilderneſs, which was, at the withdrawing and abſence of the man-child Spirit, from her, as to ſuch viſibility thereof, in true ſigns and wonders, as was afforded, and, for a ſeaſon, continued, in and to the primitive Goſpel-Church. So, her proper cloathing became ſack-cloth, in which, ſhe is to remain, <hi>waiting the return of her</hi> ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34311:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Lord, in the latter rain</hi> of his Spirit, in <hi>the laſt days,</hi> whereby ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Saints will, again, come forth, in a viſibility of ſpiritual life (all along their ſack-cloth ſtate, hid with Chriſt, in God) through the wonder-working power thereof, beyond what was experienced in the primitive Goſpel-day. Between theſe two ſignal rains, or powrings forth of the Spirit, the dead body of Chriſt, or crucified na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man of Saints, is the ſtate wherein they are ſhut up, for a like trial and fixed exerciſe of their faith in Chriſt's ſecond and ſpiritual coming, as the true ſeed of Faith were ſhut up in, under the Law, as to his firſt coming, in Fleſh. But, with this advantageous difference; by his firſt coming, ſuffering, and exaltation, in our nature, the birth of the man-child-ſpirit therein, became a means of the actual and viſible powring forth of the ſaid Spirit, on Saints, as long as the firſt ſhower thereof, continued. And, the withdrawing the viſible preſence of that Spirit, ever ſince, is ſo far from being any juſt argument, whence to conclude the total ceaſing thereof, that it ought, rather, to be a ſtrengthning motive, for expecting the like, yea, and a greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and demonſtration, that it will break forth in, at its return. This ſhould quicken up, in Saints, a ſteddy, fervent and well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded deſire, after the ſame, in <hi>the latter rain</hi> thereof, which is to ripen and bring in, the full harveſt of the ſpiritual ſeed, of which <hi>the former rain</hi> afforded but <hi>an earneſt and firſt fruits.</hi> This ought to encourage the (as yet) inviſible Spiritual Saints, by faith, to wait for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of his Spirit, <hi>in the end of the year,</hi> or laſt age of this World, by the powring down thereof, in a much more tranſcendent clearneſs, and viſible demonſtration, than ever, before. Spiritual Saints, then, in this long ſeaſon of God's withdrawing the viſible preſence of his Goſpel-Spirit, for wiſe and holy ends, are, by a fixed faith therein, to be faithful witneſſes of Chriſt's ſpiritual life, in their ſack-cloth ſtate of prophecy, experienced for many paſt ages; forasmuch as thoſe infallible marks of Chriſt's viſible ſpiritual preſence, whilſt pretended to, by all, have bin found wanting in all ſocieties of Chriſtians, ever ſince his withdrawing. During this ſeaſon, ſack-cloth is the ſafeſt clothing for the chaſt ſpouſe of Chriſt, in which, ſhe is, by a perfect ſubjection to his will, to wait for his ſecond coming, with longing deſire; and, not dare, in the life and activity of her own will or ſpirit, to be found untimely <hi>ſtirring up</hi> or awakning <hi>her beloved,</hi> before the appointed time <hi>for his return from his far Country.</hi> By faith, are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34311:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> they <hi>to wait,</hi> for this, <hi>and not make haſte,</hi> from the impatience of their own ſpirit; but, by a conſtant growth in his, <hi>to haſten towards his ſpiritual coming</hi> that they may, daily, be more fitted to ſee him, through an encreaſing likeneſs to him, therein; 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 2. They are to withdraw from the voice of every Stranger,</hi> not bowing to any falſe power or ſpirit, and to acquit themſelves as Chriſt's faithful witneſſes in their very ſack-cloth prophecy, and inviſible ſpiritual ſaintſhip. After this manner, has God kept his witneſſing-work, on foot, in this long black and dark ſeaſon of ſack-cloth-prophecy. The ſecond of <hi>the two days (Hoſ.</hi> 6. 2, 3.) was the primitive Goſpel-day, by <hi>the former rain,</hi> or, firſt ſhower of the reſurrection-ſpirit, from our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified nature, in Chriſt; inſtituting, for the ſeaſon of it, a much more ſpiritual revelation and worſhip of himſelf, then in the firſt witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing day of ſpiritual Saints, by faith, under the dark diſpenſation of the Law. But, this firſt Goſpel-day, as to the viſibility thereof, has had its ſucceeding long night-ſeaſon of <hi>Sack-Cloth-prophecy.</hi> After this, then, is to follow a third and more joyful day, than ever before. The dawning, or morning-light of this, will begin, on <hi>the latter rain,</hi> by which, <hi>God will revive and raiſe up his people,</hi> cauſing his ſpiritual life, reſurrection-power and ſtrength, to ſhine forth in them, beyond what was experienced in the former Goſpel-day. <hi>In this third</hi> and laſt <hi>day, will he raiſe up his Saints, out of the grave</hi> of their crucified natural Spirits, <hi>and cauſe them, for ever, to live in his ſight,</hi> in the viſible glory of his new-creation-life. This third day begins, after the ending of the Sack-cloth prophecy; on the ending of which, <hi>the two witneſſes are to be ſlain, by the beaſt, aſcending out of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> with new, hidden weapons, <hi>to war upon them, overcome and kill them.</hi> And, <hi>their dead bodies muſt lie in the ſtreet of the great City, ſpiritually called</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Egypt, <hi>where, alſo, our Lord was crucified; Rev.</hi> 11. 8. The peculiar ſeaſon for an eminent <hi>ſlaying the two witneſſes,</hi> may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by the means or hands, by which to be ſlain, ſpiritually, or literally. It is, by <hi>Satan's coming out of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> with the utmoſt <hi>depths</hi> of deceit (in which he has lain hid from the beginning) by his conjunctive viſible and inviſible power, <hi>to war againſt, and kill them.</hi> Theſe ſubtile workings, by his ſaid twofold power, reſerved by him, for the laſt times of all, has Chriſt fore-warn'd his Saints, of. Firſt, he will, then, more powerfully, than ever before, influence both the clean and corrupt principles of nature, in men, ſo as to cauſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34311:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> a more univerſal <hi>abounding in all ſorts of iniquity,</hi> then ever, before. Hereby, will he render men, as willing and ready inſtruments, to exerciſe his perſecuting malice, <hi>againſt the Saints of the moſt high,</hi> as he can deſire. In that ſeaſon, above all other, will Saints be <hi>hated and betrayed by all Nations, and killed for Chriſt's</hi> new <hi>name-ſake,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing left them, but ſuch an enduring to the end, as ſhall render them <hi>more than Conquerors.</hi> For, it is Chriſt's quarrel, not their own, in which they contend. Under this ſharp trial, deſtitute of all viſible relief, will they be ſomewhat helped by God's outward providential dealings with (and puniſhings of) the World. Hereby, in ſome meaſure, will he avenge his own and peoples quarrel, ſo that while all natural principles ſhall center and agree, in the ſlaying them, God will, from unknown cauſes, ſet every man's ſword againſt his fellow, cauſing a univerſal commotion, <hi>war, and rumour of wars, thorow-out the whole Earth. Nation ſhall riſe up againſt Nation, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom.</hi> Yea, and divers places ſhall, after a wonderful manner, be viſited with <hi>Famine, Peſtilence, and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</hi> Yet, though a ſignal hand of God will be evident in all theſe judgments, this laſt and moſt ſinful age of the World, will, in a ſelf-condemning-light, be willingly hurried by the Devil, ſo as in a hardned contempt and wilful neglect of all the voices of God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to gratify themſelves, in all ſorts of luſts and vanities. And, they will practiſe the ſame, in an enraged enmity againſt God, Chriſt, and Saints. All this will ripen them for their final deſtruction. From their implacable malice, for the juſt hand of God, upon them, will they take all opportunities to effect what they have long deſired, even the compleat <hi>ſlaughter of the two witneſſes.</hi> And, in all this, the Devil diſcovers himſelf, only, in his powerful influencing of outward and viſible means, towards the carrying on this great deſign. But, he is furniſhed, alſo, with inward, myſtical weapons (to fight againſt God and his ſpiritual Saints, in this latter age) that are of a more dangerous nature, than the other. For, theſe will he uſe, as in the very name and authority of Chriſt, committing, therein, the higheſt treaſon againſt him. In ſuch exerciſe of his diabolical power, will he ſend forth his falſe ſpirits, in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s new-creation-name, as <hi>falſe Chriſts,</hi> to make <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> joining men with themſelves, in all ſorts of ſpiritual craft, to deceive Spiritual Saints. This, by ſuch <hi>lying ſigns and wonders,</hi> of ſuch a deep, hidden nature, as, if Chriſt had not laid
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34311:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> an impoſſibility on them, <hi>would deceive the very Elect.</hi> On the one hand, in imitation of the Croſs of Chriſt, will Satan ſay, <hi>he is in the Wilderneſs or ſecret Chambers:</hi> on the other, in a counterfeit reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction-ſtate, will he exalt himſelf, by ſinful transformation, into his heavenly, ſpiritual life. All this, by an angelical miniſtration, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt's fore-running diſpenſation to his everlaſting Goſpel-day, by his holy Angels, to be at hand, as the only means <hi>to raiſe up his ſlain witneſſes out of their Graves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, have we obſerved the hand or means, by which, <hi>the two witneſſes are to be ſlain,</hi> and, what the ſlaying of them, is. Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inviſible enemies, Men and Devils, will combine againſt them, to bring them into ſuch a captivity, as all former, under Law or Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, have bin but fore-running types of; and ſo ſeen, by ſpiritual Prophets, and Saints, under both diſpenſations. <hi>Jeremy, Ezekiel, Daniel, &amp;c.</hi> have declared this laſt and great <hi>day of ſore trouble, ſuch as never hath been, or ſhall be.</hi> So, alſo, hath Chriſt himſelf propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 21. This very ſeaſon is, indeed, the ſum of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s many viſions; the reſult of what is held forth, by <hi>the two Kings of the North and South,</hi> in all the variety and differing appearances they have bin in, towards one another, through the common profaneneſs of the former, in the cold, dead, corrupt ſpirit of nature; and the warmth or zeal of the latter, in, and for the firſt-covenant life and righteouſneſs of Man. Through the powerful influence of the Devil, on both, can he ſoder and unite them, in a combination <hi>againſt the Saints of the moſt high,</hi> ſo as to bring forth <hi>a day of utmoſt</hi> trial and <hi>trouble, to them.</hi> For this end, <hi>Daniel ſaw theſe two Kings, joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> as the Devil's twofold weapon, in the corrupt and refined principles of nature, <hi>ſpeaking lies at one Table (Dan.</hi> 11. 27.) and <hi>ſetting,</hi> or <hi>joyning, their hearts</hi> and hands, <hi>to miſchief true Saints.</hi> And ſo, both of them, in union of mind with the Devil, will do his work, in effecting <hi>the death of the two witneſſes.</hi> Thus, will Satan, by the practiſe of the moſt refined ſpiritual wickedneſs, and in the expreſſing greater malice than ever before (when his reign draws neer, to an end) employ all his inſtruments of cruelty, muſter up all his force, and power, for the ſlaying of <hi>Chriſt's two witneſſes.</hi> And he, with his inſtruments, will proſper herein, to the accompliſhing of their death. This we find in the mighty King in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that was to ariſe laſt; and the beaſt, in <hi>John</hi>'s viſion, that at end of <hi>the Sack-cloth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34311:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> prophecy, was to aſcend out of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> furniſhed with all ſorts of weapons and inſtruments, not only <hi>to war upon,</hi> but overcome <hi>and kill Chriſt's twofold witneſſing Saints, magnifying himſelf againſt the God of Gods.</hi> The ſame thing was repeated to <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the viſion of <hi>the four beasts,</hi> commonly underſtood to point out thoſe four Monarchies, that are to ſpend out the remaining ages of the World, during the Devil's active power, and <hi>man's day. The fourth beaſt,</hi> is deſcribed, as far worſe than any of his Fellows, being <hi>ſtrong, dreadful and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible;</hi> and, ſo furious and malicious, as with its <hi>great iron teeth,</hi> not only <hi>to devour and break in pieces,</hi> but <hi>stamp the reſidue under his feet.</hi> This beaſt had alſo <hi>ten horns, and another little horn came up among them,</hi> which is, in a ſignal manner, <hi>to war with and prevail againſt the Saints of the moſt high;</hi> Dan. 7. 21. <hi>The fourth beast and little horn</hi> figure out the utmoſt ſtrength, the Devil, from the beginning, kept in reſerve, for this laſt and moſt bloody deſign. At the end of <hi>the Sack-cloth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi> in the appointed time of <hi>three years and an half, will the two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes be ſlain by the little horn, Daniel ſaw come up laſt,</hi> and, in the leaſt and moſt unlikely appearance for ſuch a deſign; yet, by it, the moſt bloody battel is to be fought, in which <hi>the twofold witneſſes are to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome and killed,</hi> and that, in ſuch an enraged malice of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as <hi>not to have any burial permitted them.</hi> By all, may appear, the Devil will then rally up all his forces, in an univerſal conjunction of all ſorts of principles that are ſingly natural, humane and angelical, to bring this moſt diſmal ſeaſon, that ever was experienced by Saints. Herein, will Satan cauſe, as was ſhewed <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſuch <hi>abominations, as ſhall make wholly deſolate</hi> all ſorts of viſible worſhip and humane affairs. Then will all moral and civil Laws, cuſtoms, and conſtitutions be broken and changed; to the ſetting open a flood-gate, and cauſing an inundation of all ſorts of wickedneſs, litteral and ſpiritual. And, hereby will be denied, both liberty to Saints, and propriety to men; even <hi>to all, that ſhall</hi> either from ſpiritual or rational principles, at that ſeaſon, <hi>refuſe to receive the mark of the beaſt,</hi> by not joining with the Devil, <hi>for ſlaying the two witneſſes,</hi> litterally or myſtically. This ſad ſeaſon, to be brought on the true ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, was lively repreſented to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> by <hi>the valley of dry bones; Ezek.</hi> 37. 1, 2. Thus, by faith, had he a view, ſo long before, of theſe <hi>two witneſſes</hi> that are to be brought into the moſt deplorable circumſtances, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned reaſon of man, imaginable. This is implied in the judgment,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34311:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>the</hi> then <hi>houſe of Iſrael,</hi> figure hereof, made of themſelves, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>our bones are dried, our hope is loſt, we are cut off for our parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> On this ſad condition and ſlaughter of <hi>the two witneſſes,</hi> or <hi>whole houſe of</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael, in the laſt and moſt perillous times,</hi> their enemies will be found in the height of joy and ſatisfaction, looking, with great delight, on <hi>the dry bones or dead bodies of the ſaid houſe of Iſrael, the two witneſſes,</hi> during <hi>the three years and half,</hi> or time of them utmoſt extremity, in which, not permitted burial. As an expreſſion of this joy, and gratification of their ſpiritual luſt, <hi>will they ſend pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to each other,</hi> as triumphing over <hi>the ſlain witneſſes</hi> of Chriſt, which has long bin their hearts deſire, even all along their <hi>Sack-cloth prophecy in which,</hi> they have bin contending with and <hi>troubling all that dwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> upon the Earth,</hi> or in earthly, firſt-creation-principles; <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On this honourable account, as contending on God's behalf, are they, at length, to be <hi>ſlain,</hi> myſtically, if not alſo litterally. But, nor their myſtical nor litteral death ſhould have been permitted, as Chriſt ſaid in <hi>Lazarus</hi> his caſe, <hi>but that the power of God may be the more</hi> clearly <hi>manifeſted in raiſing them</hi> up again, <hi>out of their ſleep.</hi> And then, and ſo, will they be fitted to execute the wrath of God, on his and their implacable enemies, as a juſt recompence for <hi>that death of theirs, which has bin precious in his ſight;</hi> Rev. 11. 11. Ezek. 37. 10. <hi>Such honour ſhall all his Saints have,</hi> as the Lord's army, <hi>to execute vengeance on the Kings of North and South,</hi> with their <hi>heathen</hi> and firſt-covenant-<hi>people, who joined</hi> in a combination, <hi>to deſtroy them; Pſal. 2. 1, 2. &amp; 149. 6,-9. They ſhall</hi> then <hi>receive the Crown,</hi> reſerved for this laſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Saints, that bring up the rear of all thoſe ſpiritual <hi>worthies and witneſſes,</hi> that have bin, from the beginning. The true witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Chriſt, have, all along, found but ſlender and cool reception for their teſtimony; yea, they have, always, found oppoſition, more or leſs. And, how much greater may be expected, in this laſt and utmoſt aſſault, by viſible and inviſible powers, when the great thing, all along, witneſſed, the ſecond perſonal coming of Chriſt, is at the door? The extraordinary voice of God's outward providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhall then alſo give an undoubted demonſtration to all natural hearts, that ſome ſtrange and wonderful change is haſtning upon the World. And, the fear and conviction, hereby, wrought in Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, will produce the utmoſt expreſſions of rage and fury, on the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34311:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſack-cloth prophets, as witneſſing this unwelcome truth to them, Chriſt's ſecond comming, to be at hand. Great reaſon, then, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, not only a more, then ever, violent breaking in pieces of the earthen veſſel, in which the precious witneſſing treaſure is; but alſo, a more enraged ſpirit, diſcovering itſelf, againſt the very ſpiritual treaſure. On this account, will it come forth, in its <hi>ſpiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in heavenly places,</hi> and ſo, with their angelical weapons, gilded with a likeneſs to Chriſt's truly ſpiritual ones, war againſt the inward mind, as well as by material weapons, againſt the outward body of <hi>the two witneſſes.</hi> But, by neither, ſhall they be able to ſuppreſs, or hinder their witneſſing-work. For, <hi>God will make them, a defenced City, iron Pillars and brazen Walls,</hi> for an unſhaken, ſteddy endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the utmoſt malice of all enemies, viſible and inviſible. They ſhall conquer them, even while ſlaying them, by ſurviving all bodily deaths, and ſpiritual aſſaults, in an unchanged mind and Spirit.</p>
            <p>And, having thus conſidered the time and means, in and by which, the witneſſes are to be ſlain; next, are we to enquire, by what hand or means, they will be raiſed out of the ſaid death. For, it is no more poſſible for the members, than head, <hi>to be held by the bands of death; Act.</hi> 2. 24. But, redemption out of the myſtical death of the natural Spirit, and out of all death, can only be by a new-creation-power. And, this was that power and glory of the Father, by which, Chriſt, in our nature, was raiſed out of the both myſtical and litteral death thereof. This done, in a publick capacity, and relation to his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, aſcertain's the like to be done for their crucified natural Spirits and dead Bodies; and that, by the ſame means. <hi>All that are planted together, in the likeneſs of his death, ſhall be alſo, in the likeneſs of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection (Rom.</hi> 6. 5.) or, be ſure to partake of his new-creature-life. The putting this life into them, is the means, by which, the <hi>witneſſes are to be raiſed, after ſlain, and lying in the Streets of ſpiritual Sodom and Egypt; Rev.</hi> 11. 8. The new-creation-<hi>ſpirit of Life, from God, enters into them,</hi> quickens and calls up their natural man, into an everlaſting union with, and ſubjection to their ſpiritual, as that to Chriſt and God; and ſo, ſets it upon its right Goſpel-Feet. The new-creation-ſpirit of true prophecy, will raiſe the whole, ſlain na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man of the Saint, out of its myſtical and litteral grave, death of ſpirit and body, as to all the mortal firſt-creation life of either,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34311:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> cauſing <hi>the dry bones of the two witneſſes, to live; Ezek.</hi> 37. 12;-14. This Spirit of Chriſt was, always, the prepared means, <hi>for looſing</hi> and breaking <hi>the bands of death,</hi> from Saints, and raiſing their whole crucified natural man, into <hi>the glorious</hi> life and <hi>liberty</hi> of their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. But, this will be done in a more ſignal manner than ever, at the <hi>raiſing the two witneſſes,</hi> in the third and laſt day, mentioned <hi>(Hoſ.</hi> 6. 2.) as their ſlaying will be more ſignal then, then in any former perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. The new-creature-ſpirit of Chriſt, then, put into their crucified natural man, or dead body, will be the efficient cauſe of their reſurrection. The inſtrumental hand or cauſe thereof, under Chriſt, will be the holy Angels, as honoured with the firſt powerful ſounding forth the new-creation-trumpet, voice, or everlaſting Goſpel-life of their riſen Lord, by which, <hi>the new</hi>-creation-<hi>breath or ſpirit</hi> of the head, <hi>will enter into the dead bodies of his crucified Saints.</hi> The ſaid Angels will be found the higheſt and chief miniſters of Chriſt, till that <hi>ſeed of Abraham, laid hold on,</hi> from everlaſting, <hi>as Chriſt's firſt born Church,</hi> come to take their place in Chriſt's ſecond reſurrection-life, over the heads of all Angels and glorified earthly Saints. Our nature, in Chriſt, is raiſed into both theſe lives, heavenly, and glorified earthly, the twofold ſpiritual and everlaſting new-creation-life. The man Chriſt, has alſo a third reſurrection-ſtate, as advanced into, and filled with the very divine life, in an infinite ſuperiority to all Angels and Saints. <hi>In him, dwells the fulneſs of the God-head, bodily,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally. He is thus <hi>anointed above</hi> all <hi>his fellows</hi> or brethren; as alſo, with the original and fountain of twofold ſpiritual-creature-life, which none of them are; but with derived portions thereof. In the days of the higheſt Saints non-age and minority, are the holy Angels, teaching and nurſing guardians to them; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. They are the higheſt and fitteſt inſtruments, to convey Chriſt's mind to Saints, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Law or Goſpel. From them, have choice Saints and Prophets, under both, received their manifold viſions and communications of the mind of God. <hi>The Law was ordained</hi> to be diſpenſed <hi>by Angels, in the hand of a Mediator,</hi> or, under the conduct of Chriſt, their head; <hi>Gal. 3. 19. Act.</hi> 7. 53. In theſe angelical flames, Chriſt, as head of them, deſcended on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and, <hi>by their</hi> voice or <hi>miniſtry, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged the Law; Exod. 20. Pſal.</hi> 68. 17. By them, was <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, through faith, his and their new-creation-head, by which, fed and maintained <hi>forty days</hi> together, without any viſible food. They
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34311:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> were the myſtical Ravens, by whom Saints received that new-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-food, that ſuſtained and nouriſhed them, unto eternal life. By their angelical repreſentations, was Chriſt, the head-Angel of God's covenant, revealed to the Patriarks before, and to Prophets and Saints, after the giving of the Law. They appeared on all occaſions, as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by Chriſt, in all the meſſages of God's will, to them. They opened Heaven, to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who, through a powerful faith, was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſee &amp; take in thoſe wonderful viſions of the very divine glory, through the new-creature-nature of Chriſt, his head, ſo as to hear the voice of the almighty divinity. They were the hand, that oft lifted him and others, up, beyond and above the ſight and motion of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpirit, and body, whilſt yet in the ſame. By the hand or power of their new-creature Lord, <hi>did they carry him to them of the captivity, by the river</hi> Chebar; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 14, 15. And, <hi>by the ſame hand, was he led into the valley of dry bones, declared, by them, to ſignify the whole ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Iſrael. They, likewiſe, ſhewed him that new-creation-<hi>ſpirit of prophecy, by which, the dry bones,</hi> or ſlain twofold witneſſes, in the laſt and worſt of times, <hi>were to be quickned and made live again; Ezek.</hi> 37. 1,—14. The Scripture abounds with inſtances of this kind. Chriſt, the true <hi>Michael</hi> ſent his miniſtring Angel or Meſſenger, <hi>Gabriel,</hi> to reveal to <hi>beloved Daniel,</hi> thoſe viſions that were to remain <hi>a ſealed book,</hi> as to their full accompliſhment, <hi>till the time, ſhewed him, for the twofold witneſſes to be ſlain;</hi> as alſo, how, by the peculiar work of the good Angels, in a preparitory miniſtration to Chriſt's ſecond coming, they ſhould be raiſed into the ſame life and ſpirit, which <hi>the Angel ſhewed Daniel, his lot was fallen in,</hi> ſo long before his actual poſſeſſion of. And, as Angels were Chriſt's meſſengers, in giving forth this reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton-life, through a ſpirit of faith, under the Law, before Chriſt's firſt coming; ſo, were they the firſt actual diſpenſers and declarers of the ſaid life, and glory, under the goſpel. They firſt preached <hi>the glad,</hi> goſpel-<hi>tydings of Chriſt's reſurrection,</hi> in our nature. This ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſervice, Chriſt employed them in, as a juſt recompence of their being his firſt followers, out of the changeable firſt-creation, into that unchangeable, reſurrection-land or ſtate of life, without ever ſinning againſt Law or Goſpel; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 12, 20. &amp; 10. 11. Hereby, did they preſerve to themſelves, in this firſt-reſurrection-ſtate, that precedency, in place, and nature, God gave them, in their firſt creation. And now, as additional to that, are they choſen, by Chriſt,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34311:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> to be his higheſt-Officers therein, for giving the firſt report of the ſaid reſurrection-ſtate of our nature, in Chriſt's perſon. <hi>He is not here, but is riſen; Luk.</hi> 24. 6. And, as in the two days under Law and Goſpel, Angels, under Chriſt, were the firſt preachers of the reſurrection-ſtate, unto men; ſo, much more powerfully, yet, will they be, in the third and laſt day. By their powerful ſounding the new-creation trumpet, or <hi>preaching the everlaſting goſpel</hi>-life, <hi>will the</hi> dead <hi>witneſſes be raiſed, and the elect gathered together, from one end of Heaven to the other;</hi> Mat. 24. 31. They will come forth, in ſuch power of the new-creation-ſpirit of prophecy, as to cauſe it to enter into and build up every part of their crucified nature, into the life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and compleat union with their angelical helpers, and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, therein; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 4,-10. And, herein ſhall they be found the <hi>twofold</hi> united <hi>witneſſes</hi> of Chriſt, in his heavenly and earthly glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit, ſignified to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> by <hi>the two sticks, he was to write upon, for Judah and for Joſeph, with their companions; Ezek.</hi> 37. 15,—22. All this, done by the holy Angels, in the preparatory diſpenſation, amounts not to the Saint's glorified body. For, that change will be the immediate fruit of Chriſt's perſonal coming, and preſence. But, theſe angelical reapers are to gather together, <hi>the firſt-born Church,</hi> written on the heavenly ſtick, ſharers in Chriſt's heavenly and moſt excellent new-creature-life; <hi>mark'd with their Father's name, on their foreheads</hi> and fitted for the marriage-bed of their heavenly Huſband. And then, are they to gather all thoſe whoſe names are written on the earthly glorified ſtick, alſo; even <hi>an innumerable multitude, in the white robes</hi> of Chriſt's ſpiritual, everlaſting righteouſneſs; <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. Both theſe, are the Angels to gather, by <hi>preaching the everlasting Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to them.</hi> By their <hi>preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom, to all the World,</hi> in the third and laſt day, <hi>before the</hi> full <hi>end come,</hi> will be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; <hi>Mat.</hi> 29. 14. They will powerfully waken up the ſpiritual ſeed of the Kingdom, in all nations; and, all that are ripe in the life thereof, ſhall be immediately joyned with them, even with Chriſt's heavenly hoſt of Angels, for the work and ſervice of that day. And, at the ſame time, will they raiſe up other ſpiritual Saints, into a land of light, a ſpiritual <hi>Goſhen,</hi> and <hi>pour forth the</hi> full <hi>vials of Plagues,</hi> on the hardned enemies of God and them. God, by his holy Angels, will lead Saints out of all captivities (as <hi>Moſes, Iſrael,</hi> out of <hi>Egypt)</hi> raiſing out of their great and laſt grave, the whole myſtical dead
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34311:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> body of Chriſt. Of this preparatory angelical miniſtration, was Chriſt's transfiguration, in his unchang'd body, before his death, a figure. He cauſed the transforming power of his new-creature-life, in which, <hi>Son of man in Heaven,</hi> to ſhine ſo ſtrongly, on his inward man, or ſpirit, that his very outward, alſo, was made to ſhine. <hi>His face,</hi> or ſpirit, <hi>ſhined as the Sun, and his raiment,</hi> or outward man <hi>was white as the light.</hi> So, the crucified ſpirit, dead body, or natural man of <hi>the two witneſſes,</hi> ſhall by the Angels powerful <hi>preaching the everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> be ſo raiſed into the powerful exerciſe of Spiritual life, as to make their unchang'd fleſhly bodies, ſhine, as a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of redemption, from the bondage of their whole corruptible firſt-creation-life. Such Saints, with holy Angels, ſhall <hi>ſhine as Stars,</hi> through a more ſignal partaking of Chriſt's riſen Spirit, <hi>the bright mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Star,</hi> from whom, they all receive their diſtinct meaſures of new-creation-light and life. In this ſeaſon and diſpenſation, will Chriſt make good, to his Saints, what he, long before, promiſed to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as aſſociated with Angels, under him, his joint powerful inſtruments for the great work of this preparatory day. Of this priviledg, was <hi>Moſes,</hi> alſo, a ſignal type, as, through faith, taken into ſuch angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal converſe, and, thereby, admitted ſo near acceſs to Chriſt, the head of Angels, as will qualify them to receive the lively oracles of Chriſt's own mind, and become his mouth, for declaring the ſame, to others. This honour will be put on Saints, in the preparatory diſpenſation to Chriſt's ſecond coming.</p>
            <p>And thus, have we ſeen, by what means or hand, the laſt genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints are to be ſlain; and by what, to be raiſed again; and, their high priviledg, and honour, thereupon. This, by the angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal miniſtration, for this very purpoſe, <hi>to raiſe up the two ſlain witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> by quickning up the ſeed of the twofold new-creature-ſpirit of prophecy, in them, into a powerful and irreſiſtible demonſtration. So, the preparatory, angelical miniſtration, is to take place, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, on the death of the witneſſes. In this <hi>newneſs of Life,</hi> ſhall their dead natural ſpirits be made <hi>ſtand on their feet,</hi> in a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able obedience to the Spirit of Chriſt, with their ſpiritual man. And, ſo ſhall they, with <hi>Gideon,</hi> the type <hi>(Judg.</hi> 6. &amp; 7.) become <hi>men of valour,</hi> for deſtruction of enemies, and ſalvation of friends. All this, in ſuch an abſolute ſubjection to Chriſt, that the whole glory of the victory will be ſeen to be God's. In this angelical day (as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34311:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> was ſignified by the ſeperation, twice made, in <hi>Gideon</hi>'s army) ſhall be uſed, only, ſuch ſpiritual Angels and Saints, as are dignified with a ſpiritual skill, for this war, upon enemies. On the firſt ſeparation, in <hi>Gideon</hi>'s army, <hi>returned two and twenty thouſand</hi> from the war. In the ſecond teſt or trial, only <hi>three hundred, that lapped of the water, putting their hand to their mouth,</hi> and refuſing <hi>to bow down upon their knees,</hi> to any firſt-creation-reliefs; but found ſingly, in a true ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Chriſt; theſe were to perform the war. And <hi>each of them were to have a Trumpet, with empty Pitchers, and Lamps in the Pitchers.</hi> Theſe empty Pitchers fitly repreſent the compleat work of the Croſs, on the whole natural man of Chriſt's ſpiritual <hi>Gideonites.</hi> So, as wholly emptied of all firſt-creation-life and ſtrength, are they filled with the new-creation-ſpirit of power, to perform the work of this preparatory day. The new-creature lamp or ſpirit of Chriſt, ſhall be ſet up in the empty Pitcher of their crucified natural man, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed body, rendring their whole man, <hi>a burning and ſhining Light.</hi> And, this lamp is the very weapon, by which, the work of the ſaid day is to be done. 'Tis by <hi>the Sword of the Lord, and his</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Gideonite</hi>'s (the new-creature-ſpirit of Chriſt, in his Saints, who are, thereby, in marriage-union with their ſpiritual Lord <hi>Joſhua)</hi> the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory is to be obtained. <hi>Not by might, not by power, but by my ſpirit, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> as in the type; <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 6. No firſt-creation-ſtrength or weapon, ſhall be uſed in this War. The ſpirit of the Lord will be <hi>the two-edged ſword in their hands, to execute vengeance on</hi> their combined enemies, <hi>heathens and</hi> a firſt-covenant-<hi>people; Pſal.</hi> 2. 1, 2. &amp; 149. 6, 7. By this ſword of the Lord and his <hi>Gideonites,</hi> will Chriſt cauſe them to triumph over all enemies, viſible and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Men and Devils. <hi>They ſhall break</hi> in pieces, <hi>the ſerpentine head</hi> and whole party of firſt-creation-rebels, againſt God and the ſecond. <hi>The Lord will,</hi> then, <hi>by his fiery ſword, plead with all Fleſh (Iſa.</hi> 66. 16.) even with every falſe Spirit, as included in that word, Fleſh. For this purpoſe and work, will he deſcend, with his angelical hoſt, into the myſtical <hi>valley of Jehoſaphat</hi> (on the raiſing of the dead carkaſes or <hi>dry bones of his twofold</hi> ſpiritual <hi>witneſſes)</hi> to make a true deciſion between his Friends and Foes. <hi>Then ſhall the ſlain by this</hi> ſpiritual <hi>ſword of the Lord,</hi> in his Angels and Saints, <hi>be many.</hi> And, this weapon ſhall be ſeen to be wholly directed by the will and command of Chriſt, their Head and King, whoſe powerful word will give the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34311:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> quick and terrible motion to thoſe angelical Chariots, in which, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints, jointly commiſſion'd by him, ſhall drive furiouſly, to carry on the ſwift execution of his will, on enemies. Of this mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Angels (furniſh'd with the ſword or ſpirit of the Lord, as join'd in commiſſion, with the two ſorts of ſpiritual Saints, and ſo, making up a twofold band or army, of Angels and Saints, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory day) is there a full account given, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. Firſt, here is a command for <hi>blowing the</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Trumpet,</hi> as the firſt, infallible alarm, to this work. This is to be ſounded by Angels, as the appointed <hi>gatherers together of the elect</hi> ſeed, among men, to the ſaid myſtical battel. And, when theſe ſpiritual Warriers are provided with their offenſive and defenſive weapons, the Angels will <hi>blow their</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Trumpet in Zion, and ſound their alarm in the holy Mountain,</hi> for the joyful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the ripen'd ſeed of ſpiritual Saints, into an aſſociation with themſelves, <hi>which will make all the inhabitants of the earth, tremble.</hi> Theſe fore-running meſſengers of Chriſt, in their new-creation-light and power, ſhall come as <hi>horſes and horſemen,</hi> and <hi>the thundring ſound of Chariots, on the tops of the mountains,</hi> riding, in a commanding power over all viſible and inviſible ſtrength, <hi>leaping</hi> and rejoycing before their great Lord and Maſter, as ſpiritual <hi>David</hi>'s, before the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Ark, for his-new-creation-ſtrength and life, put into them. For, by the angelical flames of fire, <hi>ſhall they devour the enemy, as stubble. They ſhall run like mighty men, expert in</hi> this ſpiritual <hi>war;</hi> ſo ſwift, as <hi>none ſhall be able to</hi> flee or <hi>eſcape them,</hi> in their moſt orderly march <hi>(without breaking their ranks)</hi> upon the old, firſt-creation-World or City. <hi>They will climb up, upon the</hi> myſtical <hi>Houſes,</hi> even the perſons of enemies, <hi>and, enter in at the Windows, like Theives.</hi> By their all-ſearching new-creation-light, will they ranſack and ſearch their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hearts, ſo as to find out, and detect all the deceitful works of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, in the myſtical earthly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And, this work <hi>will make the hypocritical Sinners in Sion, to fear and tremble,</hi> as found wilful enemies to this ſpiritual army. <hi>They will kindle a</hi> myſtical <hi>Fire,</hi> in their ſpirits, that ſhall, forever, burn in them; and, this, yet, but preparatory to what is reſerved by Chriſt's final ſentence, to be brought upon them, which is near at hand. When he comes, <hi>he will utter his own voice before his Army,</hi> as head of them; <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 11. And, the execution of the ſaid voice, will be very terrible to all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, who ſhall be <hi>devoured by the fire that proceeds out of their mouths,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:34311:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> as found implacable <hi>enemies to the glad tydings of the Lord's approach.</hi> That, which is unſpeakable joy, to friends, will be unexpreſſible terror and vexation, to enemies. This twofold differing reception and effect of Chriſt's ſecond coming, we find, on the concluding ſound of <hi>the ſeventh Trumpet</hi> of Chriſt's new-creation-voice, on which, he actually takes poſſeſſion of <hi>all</hi> the viſible and inviſible <hi>Kingdoms of this World.</hi> On this, follow loud acclamations of ſpiritual Saints; but, anger, vexation, and madneſs, in the enemies thereof; <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15,—18.</p>
            <p>The work, then, of the preparatory diſpenſation to Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is twofold. To the joyful receivers of their <hi>everlaſting Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> will the holy Angels adminiſter ſuitable recompences of Chriſt's love, as true <hi>fearers of his name,</hi> ſmall or great, ſingle or double-portion'd, heavenly or earthly ſpiritual Saints. And, the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar generation of Saints <hi>(that are</hi> to be <hi>his two</hi>-fold <hi>witneſſes,</hi> ſlain for their faithful teſtimony) as their particular recompence, <hi>will be called up,</hi> by the holy Angels, into a fellowſhip with them, in their angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal miniſtration. And, by the powerful entrance of Chriſt's new-creature-life, into them, will they be raiſed, as found by the angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reapers, the full ripe corn, <hi>to be gathered up, by them,</hi> into that preparatory ſervice, with themſelves. Next theſe, will they take care of that precious ſeed-wheat, that lies hid, under the earth of the natural ſpirit; or, at moſt, appears but in its young and tender blade. Theſe ſpiritual <hi>Watchmen</hi> and preachers of that day, are, by Chriſt's command, to take care of ſuch. The Angels that were to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Seals, and <hi>pour forth the vials</hi> of God's wrath <hi>on the Earth, are required not to hurt the graſs of the new Earth, neither any green thing or tree;</hi> not the ſeed, or any the leaſt beginnings of an ever-green ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life. The ſpiritual ſeed, however <hi>hid in the earth</hi> of the, yet, active natural ſpirit, <hi>ſhall,</hi> by their powerful <hi>preaching the everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> be made wonderfully to <hi>ſpring up,</hi> grow and proſper; ſo that this holy ſeed, from among all nations, ſhall abundantly <hi>flow in, unto them,</hi> in thoſe days of ſuch a univerſal <hi>return out of all captivities,</hi> as hath been the well-grounded hope, and relieving expectation of Saints, in all former ages. From the redemption of the ſpiritual ſeed, by the preparatory miniſtry of Angels, will flow a full <hi>reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the whole Earth.</hi> The Earth, not yet brought to trial, ſhall, by the powerful preaching of the Angels, become <hi>as the garden of Eden;</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:34311:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> and, by obedience thereunto, be, in meaſure, reſtored to their firſt-creation-ſtate, in order to their experiencing a far greater mercy, by Chriſt's perſonal preſence, if the fault be not their own, when brought under ſuch great and high advantages.</p>
            <p>And, having thus ſeen the firſt part of the work of this preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſpenſation, in reference to the good ſeed and innocent earth: the ſecond, we ſhall find to be, in reference to the evil ſeed, who' after all trial, by wilfully rejecting the truth, have ſhewed themſelves <hi>the accurſed earth. John</hi> ſaw the ſame time apointed for a recompence of love, to the one; and wrath, to the other. Theſe latter, are <hi>the Nations that will be angry, at Chriſt's ſecond coming.</hi> Yea, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory diſpenſation thereunto, will there be ſet up ſuch a condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimony in the hearts of the incorrigibly wicked, as will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, even that, <hi>a day of gloomineſs, clouds, and thick darkneſs, to them; Joel</hi> 2. 2. Even their reſtor'd natural ſtate, on which they have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhall be ſo ſignally judg'd and blaſted by the breath of the Lord (in this his preparatory day, ſet up in <hi>his Angels and riſen witneſſes)</hi> that <hi>it ſhall be left behind them, as a waſte and deſolate Wilderneſs,</hi> with whom, the Lord will have no more to do, in any way of love, or trial; <hi>ver.</hi> 3. This ſeaſon is to put a period to the Serpent's active reign (and Chriſt and his Saint's paſſive) and to bring <hi>the ſeat of the Whore and Beaſt, to judgment,</hi> who will therefore, be enraged, more than ever, againſt Chriſt, and his Saints and Angels. Then will they come forth in the moſt ſubtile imitations of Chriſt's preparatory ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical miniſters. For this, will Satan prepare his evil angelical Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, and take his fixed evil ſeed, among men, into a like aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Chriſt's bleſſed Angels and Saints, ſo, as exquiſitely to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit this preparatory miniſtration of Chriſt, <hi>to the deceiving, if poſſible, the very Elect.</hi> He will cloath his <hi>falſe Apoſtles, Prophets and Servants,</hi> through his ſinful transformations, with an appearance of Chriſt's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection-Garments. And ſo, will he aſſume to himſelf, the very creature-throne of Chriſt, ſetting up himſelf, in that glorified Temple, in imitation of Chriſt's united divine and creature-natures, <hi>ſhewing himſelf to be God: 2 Theſſ.</hi> 2. 4. This, will the Devil, by his inſpired inſtruments, ſet himſelf to do, <hi>in theſe latter days,</hi> counterfeiting the Spirit of Chriſt, in himſelf and Saints, as ſpiritual Magicians, to fight againſt the ſpiritual <hi>Moſes</hi>'s of that day, bleſſed Angels and Saints, in the moſt ſubtile imitation of their ſpiritual and true won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-working
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34311:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> power. This will Satan do, to weaken the authority of their ſpiritual miniſtration, from implacable hatred thereunto. In this myſtical way of oppoſing Chriſt (and his work, to be done by Angels and Saints) will he and his party of Angels and Men, be counterfeiting <hi>the ſigns and wonders,</hi> wrought by the new-creation-power and ſpirit of Chriſt. This will they do, notwithſtanding the ſignal judgments of God, upon them, as on the type, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Egyptians.</hi> God's judgments, then, inſtead of working them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an obedience to his meſſage, were, by them, abuſed, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing their wilful hatred of that hand and power, they could not but confeſs juſt, in ſmiting them. Yet, in height of contempt, would they be imitating that new-creation-power, by which, they were convinced, the wonders of that day, were wrought. All this was but a type of what, the myſtical <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Subjects will do, in the preparatory day to Chriſt's ſecond coming. And, for a ſeaſon, will they be permitted ſo to do, <hi>to try</hi> and prove <hi>many. Many, that are</hi> ſpiritually <hi>wiſe,</hi> will be found ſtumbling and falling, hereby. But, being unwillingly miſtaken, their very miſtake will be cauſed to tend to <hi>the purifying of their faith,</hi> and alſo, to the ripening of their enemies, for deſtruction. This was figured by <hi>the red Sea,</hi> that became a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal deſtruction to the enemy, and ſalvation, to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> All this ſhall be more eminently ſeen, in wilful hardners of their hearts, againſt this powerful miniſtration of Angels. On ſuch wilful Sinners, in that day, <hi>will the</hi> ſaid <hi>Angels pour forth the vials of Gods wrath,</hi> ſealed up, from the beginning, to this appointed ſeaſon. In whatever deceitful appearances, ſuch Sinners will be found out, and puniſhed, under the diſtinct <hi>vials of wrath,</hi> poured fourth upon them. And, they ſhall all be made to ſtand as convicted and condemned perſons, in their own conſciences, by the powerful light of this angelical miniſtry, as Chriſt's inferiour court of judicature, in order to receive an irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſentence of Death, from the higheſt ſeat of judgment, from which can be no appeal, being ſet up in Chriſt's perſon, by whom as ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord, to be pronounced. Yet, ſhall not this ſentence be finally executed upon them, but, on purpoſe, ſuſpended, during <hi>the thouſand years</hi> active <hi>reign of Christ, in which they are to be ſo chained up,</hi> as to be diſabled to make the leaſt reſiſtance, or give any interruption thereunto. This powerful reſtraint, as to the expreſſing their enmity againſt the peaceable reign of Chriſt and his Saints, will
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34311:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> much encreaſe their torment. But, let us, now, reſume, and come to a more particular and diſtinct conſideration of all theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is meant by the <hi>Seales, the opening thereof,</hi> and <hi>pouring forth of the</hi> ſaid <hi>Vials? Secondly,</hi> how, and in what manner are they to be poured forth, and upon whom? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> how far are the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof to reach, viſible or inviſible, in this preparatory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation? We ſhall find information, as to each of theſe particulars, in the viſions given <hi>John,</hi> not only of <hi>things preſent,</hi> but, <hi>to come.</hi> This, by opening the heavenly door of the reſurrection-ſtate, in Chriſt's perſon, on which, <hi>he heard the ſound of an angelical Trumpet, ſaying, Come up hither, and I will ſhew thee things to come; Rev.</hi> 4. 1. Hence, <hi>John</hi> acknowledg'd all the light and information he received of that ſtate, to be given him, by the miniſtry of Angels, as revealers of the ſealed-up judgments, for all ſorts of enemies, anſwerable to their more or leſs criminal offences. And, theſe judgments are to be viſibly manifeſted, in the laſt, preparatory diſpenſation to Chriſt's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming.</p>
            <p>To the firſt. At the appointed time, for opening the Seals, are the Vials, and judgments therein contained, to be poured forth. Both and all, are to be, in the preparatory diſpenſation to Chriſt's ſecond coming. Then is to be diſpenſed that wrath of God, wilful Sinners in this old World (or firſt-creation-ſtate) againſt the light of the new, <hi>have bin treaſuring up to themſelves, againſt this day.</hi> After all trial, and God's long forbearance, theſe judgments, which have bin long ſealed up, are to be executed upon them. And, they ſhall be ſeen by them, on whom executed, to have bin juſtly deſerved by them, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, inflicted on them. By the light of this angelical miniſtry, ſhall all ſuch Sinners be convinced, that the diſtinct <hi>vials</hi> of wrath, <hi>poured forth upon them,</hi> juſtly belong to them. This twofold work, <hi>John</hi> was ſhewed to be the joint buſineſs of bleſſed Angels and Saints, in this preparatory diſpenſation. He gives a large and full account thereof; <hi>Rev. 5. 6. &amp;</hi> 7. He ſaw <hi>the Lamb,</hi> the head of Angels, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Seals</hi> for them, and alſo for Saints, who are called up, into an aſſociation with them, in the ſame Goſpel-miniſtry, as jointly uſed by Chriſt, in the ſaid work. They are both, by their ſpiritual Head, joyned, in commiſſion, for this work, the opening of <hi>the ſealed-up judgments of God,</hi> to the World. So, under Chriſt, come they forth,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34311:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> in his conquering new-creature-ſpirit, over the World, as was <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to John, on the Lamb's opening the firſt Seal,</hi> on which the bleſſed Saint and Angel, as <hi>horſe and rider,</hi> arm'd with Chriſt's riſen ſpirit, <hi>go forth, conquering and to conquer; Rev.</hi> 6. 1, 2. So, on the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive opening the other Seals, according to their diſtinct commiſſions, are they to make every part of the condemned World, quickly to feel the effects of the judgments, contained therein. For, by <hi>opening the ſecond Seal, peace is to be taken from the Earth,</hi> or, earthly natural principle and ſtate of life, corrupt or righteous, that, from its <hi>ſenſual and deviliſh</hi> mind, inſtead of willingly and obediently ſubmitting, has wilfully and rebelliouſly <hi>done deſpite, to the ſpirit of grace.</hi> As the juſt puniſhment of ſuch offence, <hi>the Son of peace will depart from them,</hi> as to his gracious offers; and come upon them in a final diſpenſation of wrath. And ſo, <hi>will he take peace from them,</hi> both his true peace, offered them, and that falſe peace they have pleaſed themſelves with. All ſuch as are fixed in the natural or earthly principle, will he make a myſtical Babel, heightning their vexation and diſturbance, by ſuch diviſion, as will cauſe them, in revenging God's juſt quarrel againſt them all, <hi>to hate and kill one another.</hi> So, by opening another <hi>Seal, Death and Hell come on the fourth part of this accurſed Earth.</hi> Bleſſed Angels and Saints, for this, are to <hi>kill them with ſword, famine, death, and beaſts of the Earth.</hi> All theſe are typical to the ſame judgments, ſpiritually underſtood, as their eternal puniſhment, ſignified by the <hi>Hell, that followed death.</hi> Then, ſee the effects of <hi>opening the ſixth Seal;</hi> Rev. 6. 12,-14. <hi>The Heaven, that will depart as a ſcrowl,</hi> is, in myſtery and truth, the moſt excellent and heavenly part of the firſt-creation-ſpirit, with which, evil Angels and Men have bin counter-feiting the new-creation-ſtate; but, ſhall, no longer, be able, ſo to do. The myſtical <hi>Sun, Moon, and Stars</hi> of this firſt-creation-ſpirit or World, in its fading life and glory, <hi>will be turned into darkneſs and blood,</hi> by the bright-ſhining light of the ſpirit of truth, in this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory day; and, become ſo antiquated, as no longer to remain in any credit or eſteem; but, as a decayed, <hi>old garment, laid aſide.</hi> And, all the myſtical <hi>Figs</hi> or Fruits, ſpringing forth from the old root of ſingle nature, <hi>will wither and fall to the ground, before the mighty wind,</hi> or powerful <hi>breath of this Spirit of the Lord.</hi> It will alſo cauſe ſuch a terrible <hi>Earthquake</hi> to all earthly or meer natural principles, foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and buildings, <hi>as to remove every Mountain and Iſland,</hi> myſtically
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34311:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> underſtood, <hi>out of its</hi> preſumptuouſly aſſumed <hi>place.</hi> It will make all <hi>the rich and mighty, bond and free</hi> (not ſo made, by a willing ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the new-creation-ſpirit of Chriſt) <hi>cry out to</hi> evil angelical <hi>Rocks and Mountains,</hi> and all ſorts of firſt-creation rocks or ſtrength, <hi>to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> hide, and ſecure <hi>them, from the wrath of the Lamb,</hi> convincingly ſet before them, by the ſpiritual light of this preparatory day. But, they will both feel and know, there is no poſſibility of eſcaping the ſame.</p>
            <p>On opening the third Seal, alſo, <hi>John ſaw a black horſe, and he that ſate on him, had a pair of ballances in his hand, And, he heard a voice, ſaying, A meaſure of Wheat for a peny, and three meaſures of Barley for a peny; and, ſee, thou hurt not the Oil and the Wine.</hi> The Ballances ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the juſtice of that day, in recompences of love to friends; and wrath to enemies. Both theſe recompences, have bin ſo ſealed up in the living <hi>book or word of God,</hi> the new-creature-ſpirit of Chriſt, as not to be diſcerned, till this preparatory diſpenſation, and powerful <hi>preaching of the everlaſting Goſpel, by which, the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be ſearch'd out, declared, and judged; Rom.</hi> 2. 16. Then, all that have faithfully <hi>labour'd in Chriſt's Vineyard,</hi> and rightly improv'd <hi>the Talent,</hi> received from him, ſhall receive an anſwerable recompence, conſiſting in the rule of <hi>five or two Cities, and enter into the joy of their Lord.</hi> On the contrary, <hi>they that have made no uſe of their Talent,</hi> or, an evil one, <hi>by an unrighteous detaining the</hi> preſent <hi>truth, in a wilful refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to improve it, by exchange of their</hi> own legal or natural <hi>ſpirit,</hi> life, or ſtate <hi>of bondage, for Chriſt's</hi> new-creation-<hi>ſpirit,</hi> and Goſpel-principles <hi>of true freedom; God will be ſtrict in marking all, done amiſs herein, by them;</hi> and accordingly, <hi>pour out his wrath upon them,</hi> in this diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All principles and actions will then be weighed <hi>in God's</hi> new-creation-ſanctuary-<hi>ballance,</hi> as the right teſt for <hi>Wheat, Barley, &amp;c.</hi> And, whatever, men's attainments be, on ſingle, firſt-creation prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they will be found too light, for acceptance with God. So, their puniſhment, for detaining any part thereof, will be juſt. And, a peculiar <hi>care will be had, of God's</hi> new-creation <hi>Oil and Wine,</hi> and, a righteous recompence, given to a faithful witneſs-bearing, in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of true freedom, for which, they have ſuffered, all along Satan's reign. This ſhall, in its place, be more fully ſpoken to. And, then will be declared God's moſt wiſe and holy grounds, why the injuries, done to <hi>the Souls under the Altar, ſlain for the teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> have
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34311:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> lain, ſo long, unaccounted for. Under this preparatory diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall <hi>the murderers of Jeſus, and his</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Martyrs,</hi> be puniſhed, <hi>according to their works.</hi> All theſe judgments and mercies are to be <hi>opened by the ſeven</hi> new-creation <hi>Trumpets, ſounded by ſeven Angels, on the opening of the ſeventh and laſt Seal; Rev.</hi> 8. 1, 2. On the ſounding of theſe Trumpets, the judgments, <hi>ſealed up</hi> (for foes, <hi>amongſt the treaſures</hi> of mercy for friends, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 34, 35.) will be executed, by <hi>the pouring forth of the ſeven Vials.</hi> All this, as the performance of God's promiſe, on behalf of <hi>the two ſlain witneſſes (Rev.</hi> 11.) for raiſing them up, into an aſſociation with ſpiritual Angels, for the powerful <hi>preaching</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's everlaſting Goſpel</hi>-life. For this, will they have power <hi>to ſhut and open</hi> the bleſſings and judgments of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in perfect harmony with the ſpirit and will of Chriſt, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both, in love or wrath, to the inhabitants of the whole World. This is implied in the <hi>command given them over that</hi> myſtical <hi>Fire,</hi> by which, the wrath of that day is to be executed; and, in their power, alſo, <hi>to give or withhold the</hi> heavenly <hi>rain</hi> of Chriſt's riſen-Spirit; and, likewiſe, for <hi>turning the Waters</hi> (of the cleanſed natural ſtate, as turned into enmity againſt the ſame) <hi>into blood,</hi> from the juſt wrath and diſpleaſure of God. By all ways, literal and myſtical, will <hi>the ſealed</hi>-up <hi>judgments of God, be opened, to ſmite the accurſed Earth,</hi> in ſuch a ſucceſſive pouring forth of wrath, upon it (figured by <hi>the plagues on Pharaoh and Egypt)</hi> by the hands of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in this fore-running diſpenſation, on this ſide the glorified body of Saints, as was figured in <hi>Eliah, ſubject to like paſſions with other</hi> Saints, in the unchang'd body; <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 17. Saints, in this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, will not only have power over the material Heaven, ſo as, <hi>by the ſpirit of true faith and prayer, to withhold or give the rain thereof;</hi> but, in a like command, with <hi>Elias, to cauſe</hi> the angelical <hi>fire to come down on their Enemies, for their deſtruction, as he did, on the Captains with their Fifties,</hi> that came in oppoſition to the new-creature-<hi>ſpirit of prophecy,</hi> by the powerful workings whereof, in him, he was ſeen to be <hi>a man of God.</hi> Wilful enmity to this ſpirit, God will come forth in ſignal diſpleaſure againſt. Now, if this power, literally and ſpiritually, was thus manifeſted in <hi>Eliah,</hi> by a union of Faith only, with Chriſt, in his new-creature-ſpirit, before the former Goſpel-rain thereof <hi>(Act.</hi> 2.) what will be impoſſible to the power of it, in Saints, on <hi>the latter rain</hi> thereof, for the ripening of Angels and Saints,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34311:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> therein, to a full <hi>harveſt,</hi> fitting them to do all things needful, to make way for their Lord's ſecond coming?</p>
            <p>And, having thus conſidered, what is meant by <hi>the opening of the Seals, and pouring forth of the Vials,</hi> in the preparatory day to Chriſt's ſecond coming, by Angels and Saints; we are, next, to enquire, how, and in what manner and meaſure, they are then to be poured forth; and upon whom? For this, it is obſervable, that every Vial hath (and that, from the beginning) bin ſuited to the more or leſs crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal nature, of the ſeveral wilful Offences, which now ſhall be laid open, however, before, hid and ſealed up. This is implied by the diſtinct places or parts of the accurſed firſt-creation-Earth, each Vial is to be poured upon. <hi>John hears a voice out of Chriſt's</hi> new-creation <hi>Temple,</hi> into which the good Angels were firſt brought, as the firſt faithful, obedient followers of their Head, Lord and Maſter, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into. <hi>They are ſent out of this Temple, with the ſeven-fold</hi> new-creation <hi>Trumpet, given them, by the Lamb,</hi> for his ſervice, as <hi>miniſtring ſpirits</hi> and firſt ſounders forth of this his new-creation-voice, to his Saints, who, thereby, become qualified, with them, to preach the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting <hi>Goſpel of the Kingdom,</hi> or, declare the glad tydings of their Lord's coming in the ſeven-fold glory of his reſurrection-ſtate, to the whole Earth. And, not only ſo; but, they are alſo fitted to be joined with the holy Angels, for <hi>pouring forth the Vials of God's wrath,</hi> on the fixed inhabitants of the Earth, who are enemies to his ſpiritual, heavenly appearance, and Kingdom. Thus, we find the <hi>firſt Vial, poured forth upon the Earth</hi> (Rev. 16. 2.) <hi>the ſecond, on the Sea; the third, on the Rivers and Fountains of Water; the fourth, on the Sun; the fifth, on the ſeat of the Beaſt; the ſixth, on the great River Euphrates; the ſeventh, on the Air.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe diſtinct vials and places, are held forth the particular aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned judgments, according to the ſealed up wrath of God, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the ſinful, firſt-creation-Earth. <hi>The firſt Vial is poured out, upon the Earth;</hi> not the corrupt, but reſtored Earth, repaired by Chriſt, as to their loſs, by the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> and ſo, capacitated to anſwer Chriſt's heavenly call. He hath, therein, afforded them clear convictions of his new-creation-life, for their everlaſting bleſſedneſs. But, through wilful refuſal of this, and deſpite thereunto, are they ſound guilty of <hi>worſhipping the Beaſt, and receiving his mark,</hi> which is the peculiar Sin, for which, puniſhed. They voluntarily pay that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34311:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> homage to the wicked Angel (that's due to God) who hath, by his own act, made himſelf the myſtical Beaſt, here meant, in his ſelf-cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen earthly <hi>ſenſual ſpirit,</hi> by a fixed unchangeable enmity to God, and his heavenly creature-ſpirit, <hi>rendred deviliſh. The ſame,</hi> fixed <hi>in</hi> by <hi>Man,</hi> with its wiſdom, and all its firſt-creation excellencies, <hi>is deviliſh,</hi> alſo; <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 15. This renders a Man, a Devil, Chriſt called <hi>Judas,</hi> ſo. One of you is a Devil; <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 70. The changeably evil ſpirit of Man, baptiz'd and transform'd by the unchangeably evil ſpirit of the Devil, into unchangeable union with him, in enmity to God, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders man a Devil. If baptiz'd into the unchangeably righteous ſpirit of Chriſt, man becomes, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the unchangeable friend, lover, and beloved of God. The cleanſed myſtical houſe, or enlightned, righteous natural man, receiving the evil angelical ſpirit, is, thereby, fixed in enmity to God. In this caſe, Chriſt found and aſſerted the profeſſing righteous <hi>Jews,</hi> with their teachers, to be. <hi>Ye are of your Father, the Devil;</hi> ſo far were they from being the true ſpiritual ſeed and Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or of God, as they flattered and aſſerted themſelves, to be. <hi>This end or laſt ſtate, is worſe than their firſt,</hi> in the corrupt nature, <hi>as born dead in Sin,</hi> but not unchangeably ſo; as now they are. <hi>Mat. 12. 43,-45. Joh.</hi> 8. 38,-44. Such incorrigible, wilful <hi>Sinners againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and its convincing ſpiritual light, ſet up in their conſciences, will fall under the ſad effects of the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fourth of <hi>the firſt Vial of</hi> God's <hi>Wrath, a noiſome, grievous ſore,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering thoſe ſad curſes, threatned <hi>(Deut.</hi> 29.) for wilful diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God's Law, when convinced of that ſtate of everlaſting righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and eternal life, that is (in the true ſpiritual, and full comprehenſive ſignificancy of it) ſhew'd and offered to them; After, ſuch conviction and experience, as by fleſhly <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> through ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual light, confeſſed <hi>(Joſ.</hi> 24.) as having been, <hi>by the mighty hand of God, brought out of Egypt,</hi> or the corrupt ſpirit of nature, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the refined ſtate thereof, figured by literal <hi>Canaan; to turn,</hi> after all this work of the true God, in and upon them, <hi>to ſtrange Gods,</hi> evil Angels, and receive <hi>Satan's</hi> indeleble character and <hi>mark,</hi> even his ſpirit of unchangeable enmity to God, renders their diſeaſe incure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and remedileſs. Their ſin is unpardonable. For, a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtate of true life and everlaſting bleſſedneſs was ſet before them, wherein to ſerve and enjoy God, for ever. And, after all their apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy and turning from that ſpiritual light, by which ſhewed it, ſhall
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34311:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ſaid light be ſet up, a freſh, in them, in wrath, to be a witneſs for God, and againſt themſelves, in their own conſciences, that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting condemnation to ſignal and endleſs puniſhment, is but <hi>ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their error</hi> and wilful diſobedience, <hi>as is meet,</hi> and moſt juſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond vial is poured on the Sea,</hi> which import's the corrupt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of nature, fixed in, and ſo, as a raging Sea, continually, foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and caſting up mire and filth; <hi>Eſay.</hi> 57. 20. They give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to vile affections, with literal <hi>Sodom,</hi> and God, in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gives them up, to take and run their courſe therein, which brings them to the ſame juſt <hi>recompence of their error, the vengeance of eternal fire; Jude</hi> 7. In ſuch a ſtate and courſe of groſs wickedneſs, men cannot, on any pretence, look for peace, with God, after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, as to the means for cleanſing them from ſuch filth of Fleſh. They love their groſs darkneſs and bondage, ſo as diſdainfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Chriſt's enlightning, cleanſing and reſtoring gifts. <hi>The wrath poured on this Sea, turns it into blood,</hi> ſo that <hi>every living Soul,</hi> that will not come out of that Sea-ſtate, <hi>becomes dead.</hi> The horrid ugli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deformity of this corrupt Spirit of nature, will, by the bright light of this preparatory day, be ſo diſcovered, as not to be able to ſtand before the ſame. Their hearts, with <hi>Nabal,</hi> from the weight of their own guilt, now convincingly ſet before them, will ſink and die within them.</p>
            <p>The Plague, by <hi>pouring forth the third Vial,</hi> lights <hi>on the Rivers and Fountains of Water, turning them into Blood.</hi> Theſe <hi>Rivers and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Water,</hi> may fitly repreſent that cleanſed earthly ſtate and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Men, which have not yet received the ſpirit of the Devil, as their unchangeable mark; but, are, in God's way of trial, brought to the teſt, under the croſs, which requires the <hi>turning of that righteous natural ſtate,</hi> though received from Chriſt himſelf, <hi>into blood,</hi> by way of ſacrifice, in exchange for Chriſt's new-creation ſpirit and life, in which to enjoy an unchangeable union with him, as their ſpiritual Lord and Huſband. If now, <hi>with Zipporah,</hi> they cry out of Chriſt, as <hi>a bloody Husband,</hi> for requiring them to yeild to his ſpiritual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, for cutting off, even holy Fleſh, righteous nature; and ſo abſolutely reject him, in his ſpiritual life; <hi>the Vial of</hi> his juſt <hi>wrath will turn that</hi> very <hi>cleanſed natural ſtate, into blood and death,</hi> in a way of final judgment on them. In the voice of the Angel, <hi>that pours
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34311:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> forth wrath on theſe Waters,</hi> is included the voice of the convinced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of <hi>theſe Sinners againſt their own Souls,</hi> acknowledging God <hi>righteous, in thus judging them</hi> (Rev. 16. 5.) for their envious, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring mind, againſt his new-creature-ſpirit; for which, <hi>they have ſpilt the blood of his Saints and Prophets.</hi> So, <hi>are worthy to have blood given them to drink;</hi> ver. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fourth Vial is poured forth upon the Sun,</hi> with power given the Angel, thereby, <hi>to ſcorch men as with fire.</hi> On this, <hi>they blaſpheme God, and repent not, to give him the glory.</hi> The Sun, here, may fitly ſignify the utmoſt ſpiritual height, attainable in firſt-creaton-life. This, received from Chriſt, in a way of love and trial; and then, retained and uſed in a deceitful counterfeiting Chriſt's ſpiritual ſtate, thereby ſhewed and offered, is ſuch an unpardonable offence, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves <hi>a ſcorching with</hi> unquenchable <hi>Fire,</hi> by the kindling of God's wrath, upon them. And, under this torment, they diſcover their unchangeable enmity to God, <hi>in blaſpheming that</hi> new-creature <hi>name of Christ, that has power over theſe Plagues, not repenting, to give him glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like ſad effect we find on <hi>the pouring forth of the fifth Vial, on the ſeat of the beaſt, rendring his Kingdom full of darkneſs. They gnawed their Tongues, for pain, blaſphemed God, and repented not of their deeds.</hi> By <hi>the ſeat of the beaſt,</hi> muſt not be underſtood the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principle of nature, under the prevailing influence of the Devil, carried into all manner of groſs abominations, filth of Fleſh. For, in this ſeat or throne of rule, is he diſcoverable by the common light of reaſon, in all mankind. The inviſible place or <hi>ſeat of this</hi> evil ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical <hi>Beast,</hi> is that <hi>heavenly place,</hi> or appearance, by which, he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes all ſorts of <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſs,</hi> in and upon the moſt refined and hightned principles of nature, as made ſerviceable to his moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſign, againſt the new-creation-ſpirit of Chriſt. In reference to this, as a peculiar favour to <hi>John,</hi> the Angel ſhews him this great wonder and <hi>myſtery of</hi> iniquity, on which, <hi>the ſeat of this Beaſt</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, together with the puniſhment thereof. The new-creation-ſpirit, in Angels and Saints, can diſcover all theſe <hi>depths and devices of Satan.</hi> For this, <hi>was</hi> beloved <hi>John led into that</hi> myſtical <hi>Wilderneſs, where he was ſhewed that Whore or Woman,</hi> that, in a yet, greater depth of deceit, removed from the waters of cleanſed nature, to <hi>the ſcarlet-coloured beaſt, decked with precious ſtones, having a golden cup in her
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34311:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> hand,</hi> &amp;c. Rev. 17. 1,-7. <hi>This Whore, on the ſcarlet Beaſt,</hi> is the evil angelical nature, transforming itſelf into the higheſt appearance of the ſpiritual, reſurrection-ſtate, in Angels and Men. The natural ſtate in both, is figured by <hi>the Woman,</hi> as the ſpiritual new-creation-ſtate, <hi>by the Man,</hi> which, this Woman would perſonate, with deſign to make the higheſt oppoſition thereunto. In this poſture, do evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, <hi>the Whore and Beaſt,</hi> come in their diſtinct natures, to practiſe their utmoſt wickedneſs, againſt Chriſt, and commit all ſorts of ſpiritual whoredoms amongſt themſelves. All this, when this Whore comes to be judged (in the pouring forth wrath, on this <hi>ſeat of the Beaſt)</hi> ſhall be found out, and wicked Angels and Men, thereby, detected, in their higheſt and moſt ſecret uncleanneſſes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The evil Angel will fill <hi>the golden cup</hi> of refined nature in men, with his angelical excellencies, and, endeavour, in Chriſt's preparatory diſpenſation, <hi>to make the whole Earth drunk therewith. In theſe laſt days, will this woman deck her ſelf,</hi> with more ſubtilty than ever, <hi>in the attire of an Harlot,</hi> ſignified by <hi>the Gold, Silver, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, with which,</hi> then to be <hi>adorned.</hi> And, <hi>by riding on her</hi> humane <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is held forth the willingneſs of evil men, to ſerve the ſaid myſtical Woman, or evil Angel, in all her deſigns. Both will be arrayed with the higheſt natural, firſt-creation-excellencies, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the likeneſs of the ſecond, the forbidden linſy-woolſy garment, preſumptuouſly put on, by both, to commit all ſorts of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual fornication and whoredom, together, againſt the true ſpiritual Lord and Huſband of bleſſed Angels and Saints. In ſtead of yeilding obedience to his command, in parting with the fading life and glory of their fleſhly natural ſtate, in exchange for his unchangeable new-creature ſpirit and life, they retain and deck the former, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance thereof, on purpoſe, to give the utmoſt ſhock of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to it. This will ripen them, for that full <hi>Vial of Wrath,</hi> that's to be <hi>poured upon them,</hi> as their juſt recompence. In this preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, every ſort of ſpiritual wickedneſs ſhall be found out, and judged, anſwerable to the meaſure of light, received, and ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. All of them will be found ſuch, as, from wilful enmity to Chriſt's new-creation-ſpirit, <hi>have made themſelves</hi> ſo <hi>drunk,</hi> by taking in the wine of the firſt, from <hi>the old Serpent,</hi> as from thence, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>drunk with the blood of the Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus,</hi> for own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his new name, life, and words thereof. So, do they make up
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34311:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Babylon</hi> in a <hi>myſtery,</hi> guilty of the deepeſt and moſt criminal ſpiritual idolatries and uncleanneſs, little before, taken notice of, by ſpiritual Saints themſelves; who, with <hi>John</hi> (when by this angelical miniſtry, made to ſee the twofold myſterious name of this Woman and Beaſt) will be aſtoniſh'd, and greatly wonder at ſo foul a ſpirit, under ſuch fair appearances. For, then will they ſee high blaſphemies, ſpiritual fornications and idolatries, committed by evil Angels and Men, in exact imitation of the chaſte wedlock-union of Chriſt and his Saints. This higheſt ſort of myſterious wickedneſs, the Devil has kept in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, till theſe <hi>laſt days,</hi> by the moſt exquiſite counterfeitings of the heavenly, reſurrection-ſtate of Chriſt and Saints. This twofold work, then, the finding out and judging the moſt ſecret ſpiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of evil Angels and Men, is to be the great buſineſs of the ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical miniſtry, preparatory to our Lord's coming. In the beginning of it, ſhall they waken up and open the ſpiritual ſenſes of Saints, to <hi>ſee the myſtical name</hi> (and nature) <hi>of the Woman and Beaſt;</hi> and, hereby, fit them to be joyned with themſelves, before the end of their diſpenſation, for the full detecting and judging <hi>the Whore and ſeat of the Beast.</hi> When the new-creation-voice of Chriſt, ſhall, by bleſſed Angels and Saints, be harmoniouſly ſounded forth, not only the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſpiritual evil of every one ſhall be found out, but the wrath due to all, guilty thereof, ſignally poured forth, upon them. And, hereby alſo, will the juſt and irrevocable judgment of God be ſet up in the conſcience of <hi>the Whore and</hi> univerſal <hi>Kingdom of the Beaſt.</hi> This is ſignified by that <hi>fall of myſtical Babylon, which will be very great.</hi> This fall will be effected by the powerful light of this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory day, ſhining forth in bleſſed Angels and Saints, to the laying flat, all oppoſers, with all their ſubtilties and diſguiſes. This, by ſuch an irreſiſtable diſcovery of the inward mind of <hi>the Woman and Beaſt,</hi> as to make their evil union appear, without any ſhelter, pretence, or cover. And ſo, both, therein will be found to make up <hi>the great</hi> myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> as incorporated together, <hi>the hold of every unclean ſpirit, and cage of every foul and hateful bird (Rev.</hi> 18. 2.) whatever fair and religious ſhews, they have, hitherto, bin covered with. The light of this preparatory diſpenſation, will be alſo the myſtical fire in and <hi>upon this Whore (mystical Babylon)</hi> by which, ſhe is to be burnt. This fire, will the Lord irreſiſtibly kindle, in and upon his implacable enemies, ſo as to render their place or ſtate, <hi>perpetual deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:34311:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> Hereby, will be blaſted, all <hi>the fruits</hi> of their natural ſtate, at beſt, <hi>after which their Souls have</hi> inordinately <hi>luſted,</hi> ſo as wilfully to diſdain the new-creation-ſtate and ſpiritual fruits thereof. So, as their juſt puniſhment, all thoſe things of their natural ſtate, <hi>which,</hi> in their day and ſeaſon, <hi>were good, ſhall depart from them, and they ſhall, no longer, find any pleaſure in them.</hi> Plagues and puniſhments ſhall come thick upon them, to the full; even ſpiritual <hi>death and famine,</hi> as the unchangeable portion of all ſuch offenders. When God ſhall begin to deal thus, with thoſe myſtical <hi>merchants of the Earth</hi> (that have bin, thus, traffiquing in the mercinary principles of the Law, ſet up by them, in a known oppoſition to the Goſpel) will the ſaid judgments be executed upon them. But, ſuch as have a ſeed of true Saintſhip, though they have bin involved in the ſame error, for a ſeaſon (ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly, as <hi>Paul,</hi> once) by the new-creation-voice of Chriſt, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Angels and ripen'd Saints, will they be waken'd up into the exerciſe of ſpiritual ſenſes, and <hi>come out of</hi> the ſaid myſtical <hi>Babylon, and</hi> ſo, <hi>not partake of her Plagues. They ſhall,</hi> then, <hi>stand for off from her,</hi> in a holy admiration at their own deliverance, and <hi>wonder to ſee her ſo great riches, in a moment, brought to nothing.</hi> All this ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, on the opening of the ſealed up judgments, for the evil Angels and their ſerpentine ſeed amongſt Men (their aſſociates and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants) and <hi>the pouring forth of the Vial of wrath</hi> upon them, which they have bin filling up, by their wicked practices. And, hereupon, <hi>will the Kingdom of the Beaſt be full of darkneſs.</hi> For, himſelf and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will be, all, diſcovered in their unchangeably black, dark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and principles, as fixed in unchangeable enmity to God and his new-creation-ſpirit of light and truth. So, will they be able, no longer, to hide themſelves, or deceive others, by their crafty, ſinful practices, as, before, they have. And, this beginning judgment on them, as a degree of God's unchangeable wrath, <hi>will make them gnaw their Tongues for pain.</hi> And, though forced to ſee the puniſhment, juſt, will they retain an implacable enmity to the hand that once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to do them good; implied, in their <hi>blaſpheming the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for their</hi> incureable ſpiritual <hi>ſores; and, not, in</hi> the leaſt, <hi>repenting of the evils, that brought them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſixth Vial</hi> (towards the compleating the juſt judgments of God, on every part of the firſt-creation, as ſet up againſt the ſecond) <hi>is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the great River, Euphrates.</hi> This, with the conſequents, we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34311:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> find; <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12,-16. This River, in Scripture, holds forth the firſt-creation-ſpirit, as having had its allotted ſeaſon, to be owned of God, as beautiful, in the right uſe thereof, on a convincing ſight, therein, given, of the better thing and ſtate, by God provided for, and offered to them. In order to this, they find, that by obedience to the law of the Croſs, God, in love, requires, from them, that that River be dryed up. Whoever refuſe to ſubmit to the diſpenſation, that is to do this; the ſame thing will be done by the ſame hand, in diſpleaſure, pouring out this <hi>Vial</hi> of wrath, which will blaſt and dry up the moſt flouriſhing ſtreams of this <hi>great River,</hi> that muſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally be dried away, and brought into a ſtate of myſtical death, in all Men, good and bad. In a more remarkable manner than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is this to be the work of the preparatory diſpenſation, to make way for the coming of the ſpiritual <hi>Kings of the Eaſt,</hi> Chriſt and his choice Saints, <hi>to raign on the Earth; Rev. 5. 10. The</hi> glorious <hi>Sun of</hi> everlaſting <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> will fill the whole Earth, with his bright rays and beams, when he perſonally ſhines forth. Then, all, in the firſt creation, that ſhall not willingly diſappear, as to their own fading life and glory (which is the due homage to his greater and everlaſting) ſhall have <hi>Vials of wrath</hi> poured on them, ſo as ſignally to blaſt and dry up all their life and fruits. And, if when they ſee and feel this, as God's juſt dealing with the firſt-creation-ſtate, they do, in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enmity to the light of the day, keep up the ſame, ſtill, as their place of reſt and ſafety, then ſhall all their ſtrength and labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, come to nothing. All their <hi>ſowing</hi> in and <hi>to the fleſh,</hi> ſhall afford them no other <hi>fruit to reap,</hi> but <hi>corruption.</hi> Their moſt beautiful <hi>Garments,</hi> wrought and <hi>woven in that ſpirit, ſhall not warm</hi> or ſecure <hi>them.</hi> The moſt <hi>curious webs, ſpun</hi> and made up, <hi>therein,</hi> ſhall, by the light of this day, be diſcovered inſufficient <hi>to cover them.</hi> Their beſt works are iniquity; <hi>Eſay</hi> 56. 6. The changeable nature of work, principle, and worker will be manifeſted. The ſtrength, therefore, and vigour of all, will be then more ſignally <hi>dried up,</hi> than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And, then ſhall God's twofold great deſign be evident, for taking down the firſt-creation-building, and ſetting up the ſecond, in a viſibility. The former is called Man's Houſe, the latter Gods. On what pretence ſoever, then, any ſhall, in that day, preſume to build or eſtabliſh their own houſe, in oppoſition to God's, they will be blaſted and diſappointed. At that time, Angel or Man, <hi>that ſhall lay
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34311:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> anew the foundation of the old building</hi> (that's then to be pull'd down and laid waſt) will find themſelves under the curſe (threatned on <hi>the rebuilders of</hi> demoliſhed <hi>Jerico)</hi> and be totally fruſtrated, as to their vain attempt, and rebellious deſign, as <hi>they at Babel,</hi> for ſetting up the firſt-creation-principle, in a towring and gigantick height, to war againſt God and the ſecond, or Heaven itſelf. <hi>God will command the Heaven to with-hold its dew; and the Earth, her fruits,</hi> ſuſpending and withdrawing the firſt-covenant-preſence and fructifying influence of Chriſt, as a <hi>fleſhly Bridegroom,</hi> formerly, for a ſeaſon, afforded them. By the new-creation-voice of Chriſt, all the firſt World <hi>and glory thereof,</hi> ſhall be <hi>(as declared)</hi> dealt with, <hi>as graſs</hi> and, all its fruits blaſted and withered, by the ſpirit of the Lord; <hi>Eſay 40. 6, 7. Their</hi> (holy) <hi>Fleſh ſhall conſume away, while they ſtand upon their Feet; their Eyes, in their holes; and Tongues, in their Mouth; Zech.</hi> 14. 12. All this ſhews the vanity and miſery of Man, as endeavouring to keep up the whole, or any part of his make, in ſingle firſt-creation-life, which is but a <hi>fading flower,</hi> at beſt. For, if not obediently ſurrendred, and chang'd for what is ſpiritual and unchangeable, the ſentence of death paſſed on it, in all, will be executed, in final diſpleaſure on the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſiſters thereof. And, when this <hi>Euphrates</hi> is <hi>dried up,</hi> in wrath (So as no longer to cover the deceitful workings of Angel or Man, in the form, againſt the power of godlineſs and righteouſneſs of God) <hi>John ſaw three unclean ſpirits, like Frogs, come out of the mouths of the Dragon, Beaſt, and falſe Prophet,</hi> that is, evil Angels and Men that are of their party, in worldly States and Churches, ſhall then be ſeen and known, in thoſe ſhapes and births, in which, they have, till then, lain hid, by a ſinful transforming of themſelves into the likeneſs of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, Prophets, and Saints. By the light of this day, will they be detected; and ſo, loſe all their former credit and authority. Therefore, though ſtill <hi>working</hi> falſe <hi>Miracles</hi> or <hi>lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> in a ſpirit of falſhood to deceive, they ſhall prevail only on ſuch Men, as are ready to be made unchangeable in their evil minds, whom <hi>the Devil will then gather together,</hi> even <hi>the Kings and chief</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants <hi>of his</hi> wicked <hi>earth, againſt the great day of God Almighty,</hi> or, of Chriſt's perſonal preſence. And, herein, will he be permitted, till by Chriſt's own ſentence, ſent into <hi>a chained up-ſtate,</hi> or place.</p>
            <p>But, in all this, have we ſeen the opening of the Seals and pouring forth of the Vials, only in their inviſible operations, for laying open
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34311:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> all ſorts of natural principles, and the ſecret hypocriſy and enmity, that is <hi>the old leaven,</hi> which hath ſowred and corrupted the whole lump of man's natural being. The hidden works of diſhoneſty and darkneſs, herein wrought, ſhall now be diſcovered and proclaimed, <hi>as</hi> if <hi>done on the houſe top,</hi> viſible to all. And all this, yet, is but a fore-running report, to the full puniſhment, from Chriſt's own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to be inflicted on ſuch incorrigible Sinners. This report will ſmite them with raging madneſs. The viſible effects of the Seals and Vials, open'd and pour'd forth, will ſhew how far this preparatory day is to extend, in its influence on the material parts of this World. As the deſtruction of the former World, was a requiſite puniſhment of the Inhabitants, by Water; will the ſuper-abounding iniquity of this, expoſe it to an univerſal deſtruction, by Fire; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6, 7. The water-deſtruction pointed out the Sin of that day, under that diſpenſation, an abuſe of the reſtor'd natural ſtate, as rather turn'd into pollution, then rightly uſed, as a paſſage into the ſpiritual. So, what God gave as a bleſſing to them, they turned into a judgment. So, the water-puniſhment, declared the nature of their Sin.</p>
            <p>The preſent World is guilty of the ſame wilful abuſe of renewed natural principles, and alſo ſpiritual enlightning gifts, by which, the ſtate of true life and ſalvation is now brought ſo near, through our aſcended nature, in Chriſt's perſon, as to give remarkable taſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>(Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5.) even to the natural principle. Yet, it is too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally refuſed, or at leaſt, not diligently hearkened unto and heeded, in this preſent age. The nature of this ſort of wilful offences, fits the inviſible parts of this World, for a ſpiritual, everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wrath. And, as the compleating of this puniſhment, muſt this World paſs through ſuch a material burning, as will become the certain diſtruction of it. Of this twofold burning, for ſpiritual as well as literal Sodomy, all defilement and unclean practices, in Spirit, as well as Body (which the World, in this laſt time, will be more filled with, than ever, and ſo ripen'd for judgment) we find the Sin and Puniſhment of literal <hi>Sodom,</hi> a preſaging type. The ſin and puniſhment, in this laſt, and moſt Sodomitiſh age of the World, is pointed out; <hi>Jude</hi> 7. Angels, for myſtical Sodomy, in an unclean ſpiritual union together; and literal <hi>Sodomites,</hi> as alſo myſtical, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, going after ſtrange, evil angelical Spirits, as falſe Chriſt's and Gods, as well as <hi>ſtrange fleſh, ſuffered the</hi> twofold <hi>vengeance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34311:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> Fire,</hi> or, were made to feel the twofold operations of it, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward, for a total and everlaſting deſtruction of them. So will the Fire, on this Sodomitiſh world, <hi>abounding in all</hi> ſorts of <hi>iniquity,</hi> ſpiritual and fleſhly, be inwardly kindled in every guilty conſcience; and ſeconded, with an outward burning up of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt World, with the ſinful faſhions and conſtitutions of it, civil or religious, melting down and cauſing all, to paſs away, as alſo the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial parts thereof. For, the Vials, in this diſpenſation of wrath, are not only to be poured on the Earth, Sea, and Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically, but alſo literally underſtood. This will cauſe the Heaven and Earth, in every conſideration thereof, as ſingly natural, and of the firſt-creation ſort, to melt, and paſs away, as not able, any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in the corrupt or righteous ſpirit and principles thereof, to bear up, or ſtand before the bright light and burning of this preparatory day of the Lord. The evil policies and practices, with the forms of religious faſhions of the firſt-creation Heaven, or firſt-covenant Churches, will render both, fit fuel for the Fire of this day. So, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of this old-creation-<hi>Sodom</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed. But, before this, as in the type, will true Saints, <hi>with Lot,</hi> be ſecured by ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical hands, as of the great family of Chriſt's heavenly or earthly glorified members. The Angels, that have the command of this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Fire, in its inward and cutward operations, ſhall, in diſperſing it, fulfil the commands of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſeventh Angel pours out his Vial</hi> (upon or) <hi>into the Air;</hi> Rev. 16. 17. Air is the firſt-creation-ſpirit, in all the parts and branches thereof, whereby, the Devil, from firſt to laſt, has come forth, in his ſeveral ſhapes and various ways, to fight, againſt the new-creation-ſpirit of Chriſt. <hi>This Air</hi> (as by him corrupted, through his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all ſorts of wickedneſs, <hi>by word, ſpirit, and letter)</hi> comes now, in the comprehenſive principle thereof, to receive its appointed and prepared juſt and righteous judgment, pronounced and poured forth by the ſeventh Angel, Chriſt himſelf, as head of Angels, in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed new-creation life and Spirit. On this, comes <hi>a loud</hi> and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>voice from the heavenly temple and throne;</hi> even the glorious new-creation-building, the houſe and throne, in and on which the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator's divinity dwells and ſits. In our exalted nature, in which, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate head to Angels and Saints, will he ſound forth the very mind of his infinite divinity, and new-creature temple, as in perſonal uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34311:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> with both. And, from this eminent heighth, will he pour forth this <hi>Vial of</hi> final <hi>wrath,</hi> on the whole firſt-creation air or ſpirit, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, as fixed therein, in unchangeable enmity to God and the ſecond. In the ſaid almighty divine and irreſiſtibly mighty new-creature-authority and power, he ſays, <hi>it is done (Rev.</hi> 16. 17.) that is, the deſtruction of all his unchangeable enemies, is finiſhed. This is implied in the effects and dreadful conſequents of this voice, upon them; <hi>voices, thunders, lightnings, and a great earthquake, ſuch as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was,</hi> before, ſeen, or felt. <hi>This</hi> is the <hi>voice, that will, once more, ſhake, not the Earth only, but alſo Heaven (Heb.</hi> 12. 26, 27.) ſo as to ſhake all earthly foundations, and the moſt ſpiritualliz'd, heavenly buildings, ſet thereon. This voice, and the judgment, therein, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and executed, will leave nothing remaining of beauty and glory, that's but of a ſingle, changeable, earthly nature. The voice of Chriſt, in and <hi>by the miniſtry of Angels, in giving the Law,</hi> declar'd its heavenly authority then, by ſhaking the Earth. But, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding goſpel-voice will diſcover and ſhake all firſt-creation-life (in the moſt ſpiritual dreſs, and counterfeit imitation of the ſecond, it can appear or come forth in) irreſiſtibly demonſtrating the periſhable nature thereof. By this voice, all counterfeit heavenly ſpiritual buildings, whoſe foundations are found earthly and mutable, will be tumbled down, and the ſandy <hi>foundation diſcovered. Ezek.</hi> 13. 14. All diſguiſes, put upon earthly principles, by the ſinful, transforming art, skil and ſubtilty of Satan, ſhall be taken off, by this voice of Chriſt, importing the clear, naked manifeſtation of new-creation light and life, in his own perſon. For, <hi>then will be voices, thunders, lightnings, and ſuch an univerſal Earthquake,</hi> as will utterly over-turn <hi>all things, that</hi> are but of a mutable nature and <hi>can be ſhaken</hi> (however firm they have appeared to Men) <hi>that thoſe things that cannot be ſhaken,</hi> even the rocky, new-creation-building or ſpirit of Chriſt and things thereof, <hi>may</hi> take place, come into publick view, <hi>and remain,</hi> for ever. The voice and appearance of Chriſt, in this invincible new-<hi>Jeruſalem</hi>-ſpirit, will be certain and everlaſting deſtruction to all that fight againſt it; <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 12. This voice will rent aſunder every part of the firſt-creation building, however ſubtly and artificially ſet up, by the workmanſhip of the Devil. As the marvellous and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing effects of the pouring forth <hi>of this ſeventh</hi> and concluding <hi>Vial</hi> of wrath, <hi>on the ſaid Air,</hi> or firſt-creation-ſpirit (kept up, in enmity
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34311:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> to God and the ſecond, by evil Angels and Men) will it be taken to task, and dealt with, root and branch, to the not only ſhaking but utter ruine and downfal of the whole Fabrick, with all its ſinful trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations into a counterfeit ſpirituality, by which, they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to fortify and ſtrengthen themſelves, to make the greateſt and higheſt oppoſition, againſt the new-creation-life, and the ſecond coming, and Kingdom of Chriſt, therein. For this, <hi>the three parts of the great City Babylon, the Dragon, Beaſt, and falſe Prophet,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil (or whole evil angelical nature) with humane worldly magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and miniſtries, his ſerpentine ſeed, amongſt men, <hi>theſe are</hi> by the juſt judgment of God, <hi>divided,</hi> or put into unſpeakable confuſion and diſcordancy, through the terrible thundrings of Chriſt's new-creation voice and preſence, upon them all. So, are they made to bear a ſhare in executing his judgments upon one another, as all found in unchangeable enmity to him. This was figured by <hi>Moab, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>mount Seir,</hi> or <hi>Edomit</hi>'s, deſtroying each other, in the valley of <hi>Jehoſhaphat; 2 Chron.</hi> 20. 22,-25. Thus, the whole <hi>myſtical Babylon will fall flat, as the walls of Jerico,</hi> under the weight of their juſt condemnation, receiving <hi>the cup of the Wine of the fierceneſs of God's wrath; Rev. 16. 19. This Babylon</hi> is the whole comprehenſive ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle earthly generation and party of evil Angels and Men, who will have nothing to pretend, as to God's omitting any ways or means, for the doing of them, good. In <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s caſe, he gives an account of the method of his proceedings with all his Creatures, Angels and Men, in reference to their everlaſting happineſs; <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. 4. All that ſet up for themſelves, in the firſt-creation-ſpirit, againſt the ſecond, <hi>inſtead of good</hi> kindly fruits, <hi>bring forth wild Grapes,</hi> from <hi>a root of bitterneſs</hi> and known enmity to him. In this, do they practiſe all ſorts of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical uncleanneſs, idolatry, and fornication.</p>
            <p>And as we have ſeen the ruine of the old World or firſt-creation (as exalted againſt the ſecond) gradually carried on (as to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God on the ſeveral parts thereof, and at length, upon the whole, to their total and irreparable ruin) in this preparatory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and cloſe thereof; So, are we to conſider what's done, therein, and by, towards the building the new. <hi>Chriſt will ſend his Angels,</hi> for this, <hi>with the great ſound of their</hi> ſeven-fold <hi>Trumpet, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together his Elect, from the four Winds, from one end of Heaven, to the other; Mat.</hi> 24. 31. This, by powerfully wakning up the ſeed of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34311:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſpiritual life, in all Nations. <hi>Then will the Earth bring forth in one day, and a Nation of ſpiritual Saints ſhall be born at once</hi> (Eſay 66. 8.) and <hi>this</hi> marvellous, wonder-working <hi>hand of the Lord,</hi> which will ſo be made known <hi>towards his Servants,</hi> will be attended with, and made ſerviceable to the diſcovery of <hi>his indignation towards his Enemies; ver.</hi> 14. All the power and ſtrength of the firſt-creation, ſhall then, like the Walls of <hi>Jerico,</hi> fall, without hands, before the clear ſhining forth of the reſurrection-power of Chriſt, in his Angels and Saints, cauſing the deſtruction of the old World, and <hi>paſſing away of all the old things</hi> thereof, as an immediate introduction to the building of the new, <hi>the new Heavens and Earth,</hi> to be ſet up by Chriſt's new-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-workmanſhip, <hi>wherein he will delight and rejoyce, for ever; ver. 22. &amp; Iſa.</hi> 65. 17,-19.</p>
            <p>Come we then, particularly to conſider the ſecond general part of the preparatory work, the laying the Foundations of the new World, or preparing the ſpiritual materials for the new-creation-building and kingdom of Chriſt. In this ſecond, as well as firſt part of the work of this preparatory day, will Chriſt make remarkable uſe of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and ripen'd Saints, fitly qualified, in his ſpirit, for the ſame. This ſecond part of the preparatory work ſeems neceſſarily to accompany the former. For, if this old World, for the fleſhly and ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements thereof, muſt be <hi>deſtroyed by Fire,</hi> myſtical and literal, as altogether unfit for Chriſt's preſence, there muſt be ſuch <hi>a new Heaven and Earth,</hi> built up, as may be found <hi>faultleſs, before him,</hi> fit for his divine and new-creature reſidence, as anſwering God's mind, for the exerciſing of a viſible rule and dominion of love, over his Saints and Angels, and alſo, of good will over all mankind, on the Earth. In order to this, will theſe preparatory builders, Angels and Saints, powerfully aſſert Chriſt's right, to the viſible univerſal rule and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of this World. And then, ſecondly, will they declare the great advantage of his aſſuming the ſame, to all the inhabitants thereof. Both theſe particulars, ſhall, in this fore-running diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be ſo clearly ſtated, and aſſerted with ſuch demonſtration, as to prevail on the whole <hi>new Earth,</hi> not only to own Chriſt's right of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over them, but to expreſs their impatient deſires, for the ſame, as their unexpreſſible benefit, as well as his unqueſtionable right. For, hereby, ſhall they be totally <hi>redeemed</hi> from the unreaſonable bondage under the oppreſſive governments of this World, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34311:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> brought under the peaceable and righteous rule of Chriſt, ſo as to perform univerſal obedience to him, in the new-creation-principles of true love and freedom. In order to this, has Chriſt reſerved a greater effuſion of his Spirit, <hi>in the latter rain</hi> thereof, to be ſhowred down, in this preparatory diſpenſation to his ſecond coming, than <hi>the former,</hi> in the primitive day, amounted to. The gradual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this, ſhall cauſe <hi>all the Kingdoms of this new World, to become the Lord's, and his Chriſt's.</hi> And, every member and ſubject thereof, ſhall receive his ſummons, <hi>his Lord's</hi> actual <hi>coming, being, now, at hand.</hi> By the powerful angelical miniſtry, accompanied with the rain of Chriſt's riſen ſpirit, ſhall the true ſeed of the Kingdom be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally awaken'd and quicken'd up, as a beginning to that full <hi>reſtitution of all things,</hi> to be accompliſh'd by Chriſt's own perſonal ſpiritual coming, in his new-creation-temple of our glorified na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And, herein, will he be beheld, before his viſible preſence, on Earth, on the <hi>opening the doors of that his Temple, in Heaven,</hi> by the powerful <hi>preaching of his everlaſting-Goſpel,</hi> in the preparatory mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, ſo as to make the divine inhabitant thereof, to be ſeen, through Chriſt's creature-nature, <hi>as with open face.</hi> And, this ſight ſhall alſo have its powerful and peculiar effect, on all the myſtical members of Chriſt, ſo as to change or transform them into a likeneſs to him, in his new-creature-ſpirit, as members of his heavenly or earthly-glorified body. This great charge is committed to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and powerful <hi>preachers of his everlaſting Goſpel</hi> (as, in figure, was ſhewed <hi>Ezekiel, chap.</hi> 43. to give his myſtical <hi>Iſraelit's,</hi> a more clear view, than ever, of the exact form and faſhion of the new-creature Houſe and Temple of their great Lord and Head; and that, in ſuch a manner, as to ſhew them all <hi>the aſcents and deſcents, and every coming in and going out thereof, with all the</hi> diſtinct <hi>Laws and Ordinances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſame.</hi> And, this will beget in them, a like admiration to that of <hi>the Queen of Sheba,</hi> that came from the utmoſt corner of her natural Earth, to behold the divine and new-creature <hi>glory of her</hi> ſpiritual <hi>King Solomon,</hi> in the figure thereof. When Saints ſhall ſee the divine King, and the glory of his creature-Houſe and Temple, with the ſubjected ranks of his attendants, in bleſſed harmony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, and univerſal obedience to him, <hi>they will</hi> jointly <hi>aſcribe all the glory</hi> of that order, and their bleſſedneſs, therein, <hi>to the wiſdom of their</hi> divine Lord, and <hi>ſpiritual King Solomon,</hi> the maker
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34311:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> of thoſe ſpiritual Laws, in obſerving of which, they ſhall live, for ever, in perfect bleſſedneſs and freedom. The ſight of this divine King and creature-Lord, and of the everlaſting bleſſedneſs of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Subjects, is to be given, in this preparatory diſpenſation. This was exactly figured out, in the ſetting up of the tabernacle or worldly Sanctuary, before <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s entring <hi>Ganaan,</hi> the type of this viſible ſpiritual Kingdom of Chriſt. For, in this preparatory day, muſt be proved and fitted all ſorts of materials, needful to the ſetting up of Chriſt's viſible Kingdom, as then, for <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tabernacle. And, the means, as there, muſt be <hi>the free-will-offerings of the People.</hi> The natural man, ſpirit, life or ſtate, at beſt, in the perſons of Saints, is their free-will-offerings, figured by the <hi>Iſraelit</hi>'s literal. So, by a happy transformation or tranſlation into the ſpiritual life of Chriſt, become their whole perſons, at length, true lively Stones in his new-creation-Sanctuary, figured by the literal 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. This comes to paſs, and this come they to, by being, with <hi>Paul,</hi> obedient to the heavenly viſion, or diſcovery of Chriſt's ſpiritual, heavenly life of truth, for which, made <hi>willing, in this day of his power</hi> (the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, angelical <hi>preaching the everlaſting Goſpel)</hi> to part with, the but earthly, natural, fleſhly life of their own ſpirit or nature, even with the freedom and life of their own wills, as their true free-will-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to God, under the kindlings and in the ſame myſtical fire, Chriſt himſelf kindled on the ſpirit of our nature, at beſt, in his own very perſon. To this, will Saints be induced, by the Angels preaching the everlaſting Goſpel-life of Chriſt to them, preſenting the riches and fulneſs of his new-creature-nature, to the inward ſenſes of his heavenly and earthly glorified ſpiritual Seed. This will, not only, fill them with unſpeakable joy, but, powerfully convince all unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced reaſonable men, of the worſhip, due to Chriſt from all. Then ſhall <hi>the</hi> new-creature <hi>Temple in Christ</hi> (figured by <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, the pattern for which, was received from the true temple-ſpirit; 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 12.) be ſo open'd, as, not only, to give a view of the divine inhabitant thereof, to be worſhipped; but, allow and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a free acceſs, and ſafe approach to the divine Majeſty. For, Chriſt is both the houſe and builder thereof, the preſenter alſo of Saints Prayers, unto God moſt high. And, for the ſaid Houſe ſake, will all be accepted, according to promiſe; even all perſons and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, found to be done in the ſpirit of the Houſe, true Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary-light
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34311:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> and, life: Then, ſhall the <hi>ſeed of the Kingdom</hi> be qualified in their awaken'd ſpiritual ſenſes, both to look into and read, with delight and comfort, the law of God's divine mind and will, engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Chriſt's new-creature-nature, or, ſpirit of truth, which is the <hi>living Book, or, word of God,</hi> in and by which, is given the viſion of the divine glory, for their everlaſting bleſſedneſs; and alſo, the whole of his requirings from them, in reference thereunto. The powerful preaching or opening all this to them, will, in a high degree, priviledg them, both to ſee and do the whole will of God. Now, in order to ſuch a Goſpel-preaching, as ſhall be the effectual means of bringing ſuch great and glorious things to paſs, the preachers will be endowed with that univerſal new-creature-tongue, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which comprehends all other tongues and knowledg. The confuſion of languages at <hi>Babel,</hi> as to the words of man's wiſdom, in his own ſpirit, nature and way, will be no obſtruction to this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Goſpel-preaching to all Nations, in the words of God's wiſdom, or true new-creature-ſpirit of prophecy. A demonſtration hereof, was given by the ſaid Spirit, in the Apoſtles. They could make themſelves underſtood by people of various Languages; <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 4,—11. In this univerſal new-creation-tongue, will the angelical prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers raiſe the ſeed of firſt-born-Saints, out of their Grave, or cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied nature, into ſuch a heavenly ſpiritual life, as will capacitate and qualify them to judg the higheſt elect angels, as exalted into a life, light, and diſcerning, above them. Yet, till then, they receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from ſpiritual Angels, as their teachers and guardians; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. The next ſervice of Love, theſe angelical preachers will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, is, to the earthly ſeed of ſpiritual Saints, to whom, under Chriſt, they are, ever to be the inſtructing and nurſing Parents, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received from Chriſt, the higheſt earthly glorified wiſdom, in the higheſt conjunction with, yet, ſubjection to the wiſdom of the heavenly creature-ſpirit, which is above it, and them. So, will An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels be ſubjected rulers, under Chriſt, over his firſt-reſurrection-Saints, in a glorified earthly ſpiritual life. Thirdly, in their natural make, diſtinct from both the former qualifications, are the holy Angels fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to preach the higheſt ſingle natural wiſdom, to the rational righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, in the largeſt and moſt extenſive intuitive way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, that principle, in Man, is capable of receiving. Theſe angelical Miniſters, will, alſo, declare the right uſe, Men are to make
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34311:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> of ſuch inſtruction, by growing out of this loweſt degree of Chriſt's obedient Subjects, that's but a changeable ſtate, into an everlaſting bleſſed ſtate of ſpiritual life, and true freedom, <hi>the glorious liberty of the Sons of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, herein, have we ſeen theſe ſpiritual builders, or preachers, fitly qualified to provide all ſorts of materials, for the viſible Kingdom of Chriſt. This, by ſpeaking the words of wiſdom, ſuited to every diſtinct principle and underſtanding, in thoſe of whom this Kingdom conſiſts, as an adaequate, agreeable knowledg of God, to all. They will declare the good will of God, for reſtoring to all, in general, the free and orderly exerciſe of their intellectual, rational, and ſenſual powers, they were, firſt, created in. But, all this, in order to their yeilding ſubjection to a ſpiritual ſtate, kept in reſerve, for them; through which, to be brought into ſuch unchangeable union with Chriſt's new-creature-ſpirit, as that is in, with the divine. The very divine Oracles and Laws of God's mind, ſhall then, as in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, be committed to theſe ſpiritual Miniſters, who by their new-creation-tongue, and univerſal knowledg, will be capacitated for the declaring thereof. They will be furniſh'd with the very eſſentials of all right miniſtry and magiſtracy, by which, to lay the ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of both, as to ſpirituals and civils, on which the viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, muſt be built. Hereby, will the everlaſting benefit of the government in both, become ſo evident, as irreſiſtibly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, not only with awaken'd ſpiritual Saints, but enlightned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed natural Men, for their full conſenting to the ſame. So, without the leaſt force or compulſion, <hi>the Nations</hi> of this new World, <hi>ſhall,</hi> in an abundant manner, <hi>flow in, unto the Lord</hi> (volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily yeilding a ready ſubjection to Chriſt's angelical preachers) ſo as to ſhew the ſame, not to proceed from <hi>fear, but, for conſcience-ſake.</hi> And, Chriſt ſhall have the whole glory of all. For, the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels will declare it to be in the power of his ſpirit, they do all; and that it is <hi>his will,</hi> alone, <hi>is done by them,</hi> in all their proparatory work. This work will ſo influence the Nations of the new World, as to cauſe the congregation of ſpiritual <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to bring themſelves, as free-will-offerings to Chriſt, the ſpiritual materials and ſubjects, of which his new-creation-Sanctuary and Kingdom, is to conſiſt. So, ſee we the high honour of theſe ſpiritual builders and preachers, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory day. <hi>Their feet will be beautiful and glorious,</hi> in this angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34311:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> mount, or, miniſtration, <hi>proclaiming the glad tydings</hi> of their Lord's ſudden coming, to reign, viſibly, in this World. They will power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and undeniably aſſert and demonſtrate his right, to the univerſal monarchy of the whole Earth. And having thus ſeen, in a parallel to <hi>Moſes</hi> his day, how all the materials of Chriſt's viſible Kingdom, are to be provided, the myſtical Stones, hewed, ſquared, and poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for compleating the new-building; we are next, to conſider, by way of parallel, alſo, the view, that from an angelical hand and glory, is to be given, of the Throne and heavenly Temple of Chriſt, as was, of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tabernacle, by the rearing thereof, before fixed in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Through the angelical light of the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory day, ſhall the new-creation-<hi>Temple</hi> of Chriſt <hi>be opened,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred much more perſpicuous, than ever it hath, yet, been. And this, as a needful qualifying of <hi>the new Earth,</hi> for ſo great a glory as will ſhine forth upon it, by Chriſt's perſonal coming, to ſet up and eſtabliſh his viſible and everlaſting Kingdom. In order to this work, let us, yet, more particularly, examine the type, in which, <hi>Moſes,</hi> in every thing, relating to it, received exact direction from God, and was, alſo, ſhewed the original patern (of the typical Tabernacle) in that holy Mount, the ſame with this angelical miniſtration, that's to reveal Chriſt, the original and ſubſtance of all. According to this angelical ſight, through faith, given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> was he to provide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Pin and Board, belonging to the Tabernacle, and anſwerable to the pattern, joyn and linke every part of the whole, together. And, ſo became it a lively figure of the compleat new-creature-building in Chriſt and his comprehenſive body, head and members, who muſt all be, exactly and inſeparably joyn'd together, in a ſpirit of faith and love, <hi>by that ſupply</hi> to each other, which muſt be <hi>made by every joint</hi> and member, <hi>according to the effectual working of</hi> the diſtinct mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the new-creature-ſpirit of the head, in <hi>every part, to the increaſe and perfecting of the whole body, in love; Eph.</hi> 4. 16. Of this compleat creature-building, in the inviſible exiſting ſtate of the new-creature-ſeed, in their head, before Angels or Men, perſonally and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, were; and alſo, as to be brought forth in his ſpiritual life, and, inſeparably, therein, joyn'd to Chriſt, their Head, and Parent, in their diſtinct, ſubjected places, as <hi>lively</hi> ſpiritual <hi>Stones</hi> in his new-creation-Temple (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.) was the literal Tabernacle an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed type. The foundation of Chriſt's viſible Kingdom is laid, in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34311:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> this preparatory diſpenſation, giving <hi>Piſgah</hi>-ſights and views of the glory of Chriſt, and his true ſpiritual <hi>Land of Promiſe,</hi> before his actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al appearance. This will, yet, be more evident, from the ſpiritual meaning of all things, belonging to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Tabernacle, the type, both of Chriſt's inviſible Being, and viſible Kingdom; <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. There was, firſt, <hi>the Tabernacle</hi> itſelf, then, <hi>the tent of the Tabernacle.</hi> and, thirdly, <hi>the cover of the tent;</hi> each, a cover to the other. This done, in the truth and ſubſtance, makes the new-creature-houſe in Chriſt, a fitted reception for the divine inhabitant, and to bleſſed Saints and Angels, alſo. This was alſo, figured out by <hi>the covering Mercy-ſeat, Ark, and Teſtimony, the holy things, put within the Tabernacle.</hi> So, in the figure, is a compleat view given of the original patern, or creature-building, in the Mediator, of which it was the appointed repreſentation, as to be acknowledg'd in root and branch, fitly figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the threefold diſtinct covers on the infinite divinity, which the Tabernacle conſiſted of. The ſingle fleſhly humanity of Chriſt, was the outermoſt cover, put upon the twofold immutable being of his creature-nature, his heavenly and earthly glorified ſpirit, fitly repreſented by the Tabernacle and tent thereof; and, as ſo, the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted receptacle to the moſt choice, high, and holy things, his eternal power and divinity: and then, alſo, to thoſe things of <hi>his eternal Power and God-head,</hi> to wit, his original creature-being or root, the immediate workmanſhip of his own divinity. In this twofold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, may he, not unfitly, be repreſented by <hi>the Ark and covering merey-ſeat.</hi> The divine and creature-nature of the Mediatour, in this firſt and inviſible fellowſhip or conjunction, are the things, as in type, preſerv'd in ſuch an inviſibility, as not to be immediately look'd upon or ſeen, by any. Therefore, on purpoſe, did they lodg and ſeat themſelves in that myſtical Tabernacle, the body or viſibility of the Mediatour, provided alſo, by himſelf, as the new-creature-Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> pitch'd by God, not Man, in which his inviſible holy divine and creature-nature, or things, are laid up, out of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſight of any. But, they are to ſhine forth, through the ſaid bleſſed Tabernacle, with ſafety, and to the comfort of every worſhipper, and attendant about the ſaid Tabernacle, according to the leſſer or greater diſtance, in which, placed. The true Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, in the capacity of branch; exalted into perſonal union with the Mediatour, as his divine head and creature-root, is become that <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34311:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> of God in Heaven,</hi> that, by the ſetting up of Chriſt's viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is to be open'd, on Earth; <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 19. And ſo, will the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat perſonality of the Mediatour, be beheld, in his divine and two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold creature-being.</p>
            <p>Thus, by conſidering the ſpiritual meaning of the Type, have we the reaſon, why the literal Tabernacle, was to conſiſt of ſo many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and alſo, for the inviſibility of the holy things, with which, furniſh'd; to wit, as the ſignificant types of the great original, that is, the inviſibility of the divine, and alſo, creature-nature, in its firſt conjunction with divine; and, ſo alſo, of the fulneſs and variety of his new-creature-nature. For, it was needful, his divine and creature-nature, in their firſt and inviſible conjunction, ſhould wrap up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Chriſt the branch, as in a threefold cover, or Tabernacle; and this, as the only means to give the viſion of his divine-nature and creature-root, to Angels and Men.</p>
            <p>And, having thus conſidered the diſtinct parts of the Tabernacle; and holy things, wherewith furniſhed; conſider, next, the form and manner, in which ſet up, to wit, in a four-ſquare ſhape, God aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtinct places of every Attendant about it, from higheſt to loweſt. At Eaſt, or upper-end, were placed <hi>Moſes, Aaron</hi> and his Sons. At each ſide, and Weſt or lower-end, were the other Levit's placed, according to their reſpective charges, as choſen into the room of the Firſt-born Iſraelit's, for the ſervice of the Tabernacle, in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſervice of love to the high-Prieſt's office, preparing and ſlaying the Sacrifices: but, not permitted, immediately to draw nigh to God, by offering the Sacrifices, or touching the Ark and holy things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Thus <hi>Moſes, Aaron</hi> and his high-Prieſt Sons, together with the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> were the firſt Attendants, in their higher and lower places, round about the literal Tabernacle. Then about the ſame, and Court thereof, at a greater diſtance, were the whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> placed, in their ſeveral Tribes, with a Prince and Head to every Tribe; and other inferiour Rulers, appointed (according to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro</hi>'s advice, approved by God) over thouſands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. Thus were the Attendants of the Tabernacle, compleated, in a ſpiritual and civil capacity. The firſt, were offering Prieſts and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Levit's; the other, chief and ſubordinate Rulers, with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected obeyers; all which, are ſignificant Types of what will be found in the original, when made viſible; as <hi>the houſe</hi> or <hi>Temple, ſhew'd Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:34311:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> and, <hi>new-Jeruſalem City ſhew'd John,</hi> do evidence. In every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, will be found ſuch exact proportion and agreement, as to manifeſt, all in the litteral Tabernacle, harmonious figures of Chriſt's new-creature building, that's to be made viſible, in his <hi>Kingdom, on earth,</hi> as poſſeſſing <hi>the throne of his Father, in heaven.</hi> This viſible Kingdom is charactred by <hi>the coming down of the new Jeruſalem, out of heaven, and ſetting up the Tabernacle of God, amongst men;</hi> both, <hi>four-ſquare, and walled about,</hi> with the reſpective Attendants, as the litteral. <hi>The new Jeruſalem, John ſaw, to have a wall great and high,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 12. And, as the outward form of the ſpiritual City and Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, was exactly figured out in the litteral, ſo alſo the ſpiritual Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants thereof, by thoſe of the litteral. The firſt row of Attendants may fitly repreſent thoſe in the ſecond reſurrection-ſtate of ſpiritual life; and they were held forth, alſo, by the <hi>twelve foundations of the</hi> ſpiritual <hi>City, on which, were written the names of the twelve Apoſtles of the Lamb,</hi> as his higheſt attendants, in bridal-union with him, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his heavenly creature-name or nature; and therein, under him, rulers over all others. In this ſecond reſurrection-ſtate, (amongſt theſe peculiar inhabitants of the third Heaven, a ſelect row of Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, immediately ſurrounding the houſe or throne) will be found, alſo, a diſtinction of place and offices, as in the firſt row, about the litteral Tabernacle. <hi>One ſtar,</hi> in the firmament of this third Heaven, <hi>will differ from another in glory,</hi> as inheriting an elder or younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's portion therein. Though, with <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> types thereof, they be all born of the ſame Mother, as well as Father, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking (according to their appointed meaſur's) of the ſecond reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection-ſpirit; yet, in the diviſion of the ſpiritual, figured in that of the litteral land of Promiſe, the peculiarly beloved <hi>Joſeph, muſt have a double portion,</hi> not only, to the other Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> not admitted any place in this firſt row of Attendants; but, alſo, to the ſpiritual youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother, <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who is alſo in that firſt row. This was fitly repreſented by the diſtinct offices and ſcituation of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his prieſtly Sons, with other inferiour Levit's, about the Tabernacle. The higheſt in this firſt order of Saints, are <hi>the bride, the Lambs wife,</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the full bleſſing of Chriſt's new-creature-ſpirit, by which, priviledg'd to enter within the firſt vail of the new-creation Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Chriſt's earthly glorified Spirit, ſo as to behold the moſt holy things, therein, even the divine glory, as ſhining through the pure,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34311:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> tranſparent, heavenly, creature-face, nature, or ſpirit of their Lord and Huſband. The dignity of theſe high <hi>Prieſts, unto God</hi> (in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar marriage-union with Chriſt, in his heavenly creature-ſpirit) is, to be placed at upper end of the new-creature Tabernacle of God, as admitted to the neareſt and moſt intimate enjoyment of the divine glory, any meer creature's are capable of. But, inferiour to theſe, are thoſe members of the ſecond reſurrection-ſtate, who alſo make up the firſt row of Attendants. Theſe receive but a ſingle portion, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that, the high Prieſts receive. Yet, in a union of love, with the ſaid Spirit, are they given to the ſervice of the high Prieſt's office, even to Chriſt himſelf and his prieſtly Sons, as accepted in their inferiour ſervice of love, and placed above all the earthly glorified congregation of ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Theſe, though leaſt and loweſt in the firſt row, or ſecond reſurrection-ſtate, are above the higheſt and greateſt in the outward row of Attendants, in but the firſt reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction-ſtate, wherein Angels are the chief. This was typed out, in <hi>John Baptiſt;</hi> though they be not the Spouſe her ſelf, <hi>they are</hi> faithful <hi>Friends,</hi> and true lovers of <hi>the Bride-groom and Bride,</hi> or of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar bridal-union of Chriſt and their elder-brother <hi>Joſeph</hi>-Saints, ſo as to find <hi>their joy compleated, by hearing the nuptial Voice.</hi> This ſervice of love, performed by the younger brother-Saints, in the ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, to Chriſt, and their elder ſpiritual Brethren, in the high-Prieſthood, (the myſtical <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his peculiar Sons) is their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect freedom. And, as recompence of this labour of love, ſhall they be placed on each ſide, and at bottom, or Weſt end of the ſaid hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Tabernacle, in Chriſt's Perſon, to the compleating the firſt row of ſelect Attendants, or making up <hi>the foundations of the Wall of the</hi> ſaid myſtical <hi>City,</hi> on which, in the ſingle or double portion of the ſaid reſurrection-ſpirit, are written <hi>the names of thoſe twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> that comprehend the whole ſecond reſurrection-ſtate, in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from <hi>the twelve gates of the City, on which are written the names of the twelve Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> or whole <hi>innumerable multitude of</hi> glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied earthly or firſt-reſurrection <hi>Saints,</hi> that make up <hi>the new Earth,</hi> in Chriſt's new World or Kingdom, figured by <hi>the twelve Tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> And, as in the ſecond reſurrection-ſtate, may ſeem to be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering degree of ſpiritual light and glory, not only in the other Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit's from the Prieſts, but from one another alſo, as their differing dignities in ſcituation, on the right, left-hand, and lower end of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34311:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> Tabernacle, do intimate; ſo, among firſt-reſurrection-Saints, will be found <hi>a differing of one Star from another, in that glory.</hi> The variety of Rulers and Governours, and alſo of Subjects and Obeyers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, were figured out, in the Princes of the Tribes, and ſubordinate <hi>Rulers,</hi> under them, over <hi>thouſands, hundred's, fifties, and tens.</hi> All theſe, compleat but the outward row of Attendants, about the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Tabernacle. Theſe are repreſented, as <hi>the great and high Wall of the new Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>the twelve Princes,</hi> or, chief Rulers, are <hi>the Angels, at the gates thereof,</hi> as under Chriſt and his heavenly Saints, the higheſt Rulers over the earthly glorified Wall, or firſt-reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Saints. And, under them alſo, are ſubordinate Rulers over infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſpiritual Saints, in the firſt reſurrection-ſtate. All theſe, with the loweſt ſubjects therein, make up the outward row of Attendants, about the new-creation Sanctuary. So, the two diſtinct rows, though parted by the Court, yet joyned in a bleſſed harmony, make up the compleat attendance of the Tabernacle, in their further or nearer diſtances, and differing ſcituations, or places. Thus, the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-reſurrection-Saints (though diſtinguiſhed by the names of <hi>new Heaven and new Earth, that abide for ever)</hi> do, in an unchangeable union of love, make up the whole bleſſed ſociety and corporation of <hi>the new-Jeruſalem City,</hi> which, ſo united, is invincible; for the name of it is, <hi>the Lord is there.</hi> The two-fold new-creature Spirit of the King thereof, in higheſt, loweſt, and all intermediate members of it, unites them all in an indiſſoluble bond of love, for ever. <hi>In it ſhall be no more curſe.</hi> For, nothing of the enmity of the myſtical firſt-creation Heaven and Earth, Angels or Men, ſhall be found in Chriſt's <hi>new Earth,</hi> the lower part of his Kingdom, or meaneſt of his ſpiritual Subjects. This was, alſo, typed by <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Tabernacle, there erected, as God's reſting place. Hence, <hi>John ſaw that Sea</hi> (repreſenting the firſt-creation-Spirit, as fallen into uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal enmity) paſs away, as forc'd to give place to <hi>the new Heaven and Earth,</hi> or two-fold Principles of Chriſt's new creature-Spirit, on which <hi>the new Jeruſalem</hi> is built. In this City, <hi>John,</hi> alſo, <hi>ſaw the Throne of God, and of the Lamb; who</hi> (in the ſhining forth of his divine and creature-name, in perſonal union) <hi>is the light thereof,</hi> to all the Inhabitants; the whole heavenly and earthly glorified family of Chriſt; the train, or bleſſed retinue, ſhew'd <hi>John,</hi> belonging to, and <hi>ſtanding with the Lamb, on mount Sion;</hi> even <hi>the Church of the firſt-born,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34311:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> and whole aſſembly of Saints and Angels, that are perfect Spirits,</hi> waiting to be eſtabliſh'd in their place of attendance, about his ſpiritual <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> that's <hi>to be open'd</hi> by the ſetting up of his viſible <hi>Kingdom on Earth.</hi> Then, the moſt inferiour ſpiritual Subjects in it, ſhall be <hi>cloathed in long white Robes, and have palms in their hands,</hi> garments of immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble righteouſneſs, and palms of victory, as redeemed from the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and bondage of the firſt creation Spirit of nature, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into new creation-principles of true freedom, in which to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form an everlaſting ſervice of love, to Chriſt, in their reſpective pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, about his Throne and Temple. The viſion of all this, was given <hi>John.</hi> An Angel open'd to his faith, the door of the myſtical Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt's glorified humanity, in which <hi>he beheld a Throne, and</hi> (as <hi>Stephen) God</hi> the Mediator, ſitting, <hi>and Jeſus,</hi> his Son and Branch (in our glorified nature) <hi>ſtanding at his right hand,</hi> as having, in that ſoveraign exaltation, committed to him, his Father's whole rule and authority, under him, as in perſonal union with him, ſitting on the ſame Throne. And, <hi>round about this Throne,</hi> John <hi>ſaw twenty four ſeats, and, thereon ſitting, twenty four Elders, clothed with long white robes, and having crowns of Gold, upon their heads; Rev.</hi> 4. 4. By theſe, are charactered the higheſt rulers, under Chriſt himſelf, to be, by him ſet up, in his Kingdom. They are ſecond reſurrection-Saints, who are the firſt row of attendants and encompaſſers of the Tabernacle and Throne, <hi>ſitting on their</hi> diſtinct <hi>ſeats,</hi> according to their Services. The higheſt ſeat for the higheſt of theſe, is beheld in a ſubjected di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not only, from the true <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Mediatour; but from the true <hi>Aaron,</hi> Jeſus, in our glorified nature, the ſupreme high-Prieſt and Parent of his higheſt prieſtly Sons, that are a ſelect number out of the ſecond reſurrection Saints, peculiarly qualified for his marriage-bed, by a twofold reſurrection-garment, earthly glorified and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly; as alſo, by a double portion of the glorified earthly, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſpirit of their Lord, implied in the diſtinct kinds of holineſs, as well as differing meaſures, by which the high Prieſts are diſtinguiſh'd from other <hi>Levites.</hi> Theſe higheſt, prieſtly Saints, ſeem peculiarly repreſented by <hi>the twenty four Elders,</hi> who, with the younger brothers, in the ſingle portion of the ſecond reſurrection-ſtate, make up the firſt row of attendants, about the Throne or Tabernacle. <hi>To</hi> all <hi>theſe, John ſaw given</hi> (over and above the white raiment of the earthly glorified congregation, members of the firſt reſurrection) <hi>crowns of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34311:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> Gold,</hi> that is, either a double or ſingle portion of Chriſt's heavenly or ſecond reſurrection-life or ſpirit. And, <hi>before this Throne,</hi> thus ſet up, <hi>in the third Heaven,</hi> encompaſſed with Spiritual Prieſts and ſerving <hi>Levites, John ſaw a Sea of Glaſs, clear as Chriſtal, and, round about the Throne, four beaſts, full of Eyes, before and behind. One, like a Lion; another like a Calf; a third, a Man; a fourth, an Eagle.</hi> By theſe angelical, rational, and ſenſual faces, or likeneſſes, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the whole number, in the firſt-reſurrection-ſtate, conſiſting of angelical Princes, or chief rulers, and of ſubordinate rational ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and obeyers. For, in this firſt-reſurrection-ſtate, as well as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>are</hi> myſtical <hi>Stars,</hi> or ſpiritual Saints, <hi>differing from one another, in glory;</hi> yet, all, with the whole earthly congregation of ſpiritual <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Chriſt's <hi>new Earth,</hi> make up, but the ſecond, or outward row of attendants about the ſpiritual Throne, or Tabernacle. And, the clear criſtal-Sea (typed out by the Court of the Tabernacle, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and diſtinguiſhing the firſt and ſecond reſurrection-attendants, through its tranſparent nature, cauſing them to behold each other, and in all their various diſtances, to behold the Throne itſelf) may fitly repreſent the glorified humanity of Chriſt. This is the bleſſed and proper medium, by which, himſelf and <hi>his firſt-born-Church,</hi> do converſe with Angels and Saints, in the firſt reſurrection-ſtate; who, though without the Tabernacle, Court, or criſtal Sea before the Throne, yet, through the union of theſe two diſtinct ſpiritual ſtates and principles, in Chriſt, do all, with unſpeakable joy, behold <hi>the Throne of God, the Lamb,</hi> and alſo <hi>Bride, the Lamb's Wife.</hi> And ſo, do all live, in an abſolute, unchangeable obedience to Chriſt, and perfect union of love with his peculiar ſpouſe, and their elder-brother-Saints. This appears, by the bleſſed harmony of theſe firſt and ſecond reſurrection-Saints, attending at ſeveral diſtances, <hi>about the Throne,</hi> ſignified by <hi>twenty four Elders, and four Beaſts, all falling down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before the Throne of God and the Lamb,</hi> in an unanimous diſcharge of the duty of their reſpective places, <hi>crying, day and night, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, is, and is to come.</hi> Theſe two diſtinct communities of Saints and Angels, aſcribe everlaſting <hi>Glory, Honour and Power, to God and the Lamb, who created all things,</hi> as their due praiſe, for their immortal and glorified beings.</p>
            <p>The laſt circumſtance, in the parallel between the literal and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Sanctuary, or new-<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> City, is this. No fleſhly defiled
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34311:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> perſons were to enter the former: no fleſhly or ſpiritually defiled, the latter. The touching a dead Soul, is, in myſtery and truth, ſuch a touching the firſt-creation-ſpirit and life of nature (through enmity to God, become a dead, unclean thing) as imports a love to, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion therewith. This touch, renders men unclean, on which, they are to be caſt out of the ſpiritual Camp and Kingdom of Chriſt. Such myſtical <hi>Dogs, Sorcerers, Whoremongers, Murderers, and Lyars</hi> (as from wilful hatred to Chriſt's new-creature-ſpirit of truth, chuſe their own ſpirit of lyes and falſhood) <hi>are</hi> for ever, <hi>to be excluded out of Chriſt's new-Jeruſalem City,</hi> or Kingdom. In this twofold work, of leading men to Chriſt, the true door of entrance, and keeping out all <hi>that climb up ſome other way,</hi> will Chriſt uſe his Angels, typed by the twelve Princes of the Tribes. They then, as the literal Princes, muſt number the true ſubjects of Chriſt's ſpiritual Kingdom, for his ſervice, in order to take their appointed places, in the ſame. In diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this Office, will they <hi>rear up the Tabernacle,</hi> as <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the very way of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s travelling into <hi>Canaan.</hi> This will they do, in their preparatory work, by giving the angelical ſights and views of Chriſt's Kingdom, before its viſible eſtabliſhment, by his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. This, in a like exactneſs as in the type, where nothing was wanting, as to the building or attendants thereof, at its firſt rearing, in the Wilderneſs; <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. The form of the Houſe, or City, with the ſeveral places of the members or attendants thereof, was, from the like angelical hand, given <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> as alſo, <hi>all the Laws and Ordinances,</hi> to be obſerved by the attendants, in their ſeveral ſtations. All this will they do, as a preparing the way to their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Lord's coming; and fitting of the new World, for ſuch a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending of the holy City, out of Heaven, upon it,</hi> as will be the viſible ſetting up of Chriſt's ſpiritual Kingdom, in it; even, by <hi>his</hi> viſible <hi>coming with all his Saints,</hi> according to <hi>Enoch's prophecy; Jude</hi> 14. Theſe are to take their places, in his viſible Kingdom, as the inward or outward rows of attendants, about his Throne. This, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are found to be <hi>the ſeed of the Kingdom,</hi> quicken'd and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſaid preparatory diſpenſation, into the firſt or ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection-life, though yet remaining in the vile body. For, they are fitted, on Chriſt's perſonal call of them, to be immediately <hi>chang'd into their glorified bodies,</hi> without death. This, <hi>by Christ's</hi> own <hi>ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the trump of God; 1 Theſſ. 4. 16, 17. 1 Cor. 15. 51, 52. Then
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34311:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhall death be ſwallowed up into victory,</hi> in all the members of Chriſt, written in his new creature book of Life, from everlaſting. This will be the happy concluſion of that preparatory day, when Saints ſhall ſhine forth, in more brightneſs, than ever, in any former-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. Yet will this day be but as night, to the Sun-riſe of Chriſt's perſonal preſence. But yet, <hi>in the evening of this</hi> prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory-<hi>day, it ſhall be light,</hi> by the approach of that Sun, that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go down, more. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 7. Then will the Angels do, as <hi>the Angel</hi> that finiſh'd <hi>his wraſtling</hi>-work <hi>with Jacob,</hi> and found him, on the utmoſt trial, an heir of everlaſting Salvation; and, as ſo, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by the weakning of his nature, under the Croſs. When he had thus prepared him, for <hi>the breaking</hi> forth <hi>of the</hi> new-creation-<hi>day upon him,</hi> he does, in the ſame faithfulneſs to his maſter, ſay to him, <hi>let me go, that the</hi> glorious <hi>day</hi> of my Lord <hi>may break</hi> forth, whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing is my lawful diſcharge (as to my preparatory ſervice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) by his yet far greater light. <hi>The</hi> holy <hi>Angels, John ſaw, at the twelve Gates of</hi> the new <hi>Joruſalem, rejoyce with thanksgiving,</hi> in their being imploy'd by Chriſt, for the good of the elect ſeed of men, in general; yea, and for thoſe ſelect ſpouſes, and peculiar heavenly friends of Chriſt, heirs of a higher ſtate of Salvation, than themſelves. All of them, while but in the childiſh, natural ſtate of Servants, do need the inſtruction and conduct of theſe <hi>miniſtring Spirits,</hi> for the ſafe bringing of them to the doors of the new-creation-City, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their viſions thereof, unto them. They lead them to Chriſt, <hi>the true door</hi> of that City, who, alſo, is the immediate opener, and giver of actual entrance, thereunto. As Guardians, even to Chriſt's heavenly, <hi>firſt-born-Church,</hi> among other Saints, while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their jurisdiction, will they conduct them to the gates of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly City, and; there deliver them up to Chriſt himſelf. Till they enter the ſaid City, muſt they own their ſights and views thereof, to theſe moſt proper inſtruments, (uſed by Chriſt) the holy Angels. Theſe chief rulers in and over the firſt-reſurrection-ſtate, are the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt co-workers with Chriſt, in the preparatory ſetting up, or ſhewing of his Kingdom, to all Saints. <hi>John</hi> in the whole viſion, given him, of <hi>things to come</hi> (the reſurrection-life and glory, in which Chriſt's viſible kingdom is to be ſet up) acknowledged all to be received from the good Angels, under the number ſeven, the figure, all along Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the new-creation, or reſurrection-ſtate. By a participation
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34311:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> hereof, do they take their principality or chief rule, over the earthly glorified congregation of ſpiritual <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> As teſtimony hereunto; <hi>John</hi> ſaw thoſe <hi>ſeven Angels</hi> (implying the whole number of elect Angels) <hi>ſtanding before the Throne of the Lamb,</hi> as partakers of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection-life. The like is ſignified by the <hi>ſevenfold Trumpet, given them,</hi> by which, fitly capacitated for the ſaid work, as Chriſt's chief Miniſters, to declare his reſurrection-life and glory; and ſo, to give the joyful tydings of his ſpiritual coming and Kingdom, to all the Earth. All this honour is put upon them, as a juſt recompence for their obedient <hi>quitting their own</hi> natural <hi>Land</hi> and Habitation, their firſt-creation mutable earthly life and ſtate, and becoming the firſt faithful followers of their head, into the true, new-creation-<hi>land of Promiſe.</hi> From the moment, in which, made or found willing, to make this exchange of life and principles, was the viſion of God, through faith, given them, in the reſurrection-ſtate. So, may they, properly, be called <hi>Elders,</hi> or chief, over the good ſeed, among Men, who receive, from their hand, the ſame Manna of life in Chriſt, themſelves feed on. They, by their more penetrating ſight and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially, as exalted into the ſpiritual, new-creation ſight and viſion of their head (as admitted into perſonal union with the divinity, in our glorified nature, and, ſitting on his Throne) and his Bride, have bin, and are ſignally uſeful, to communicate the viſion of both, till the time for theſe heavenly Saints exaltation into the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of the marriage bed. Thus, <hi>they ſhewed John, the Lamb, and his Bride,</hi> or peculiar, and moſt heavenly Saints, in a ſubjected love, unto both, as inferiour to both, yet, having their joy compleated by a perfect love to both; <hi>acknowledging themſelves to be neither Bridegroom, nor Bride, but</hi> true <hi>friends</hi> and faithful <hi>Servants, unto both.</hi> This, their admirable love, to Chriſt and his moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Saints, is notably figured out, in that of <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David. David</hi> is a figure of the moſt heavenly Saint, <hi>as made,</hi> moſt compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>after God's own heart. Jonathan</hi>'s true love to him, figures out that of the elect Angel, to the ſuperiour, heavenly Saint. <hi>His love to David exceeding the love of Women,</hi> properly deſcribes the ſpiritual union of the good Angel with the moſt heavenly Saint, as maintained by pure new-creation-principles, in both. Such love and union muſt needs greatly excel any love, exerciſcable in the natural or firſt-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-ſpirit, typed out by the Woman, which <hi>(Diotrophes-like) covets a pre-eminency,</hi> in its own name and glory. Contrary hereunto, new-creation-principles
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34311:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> cauſe the angelical <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s, not only, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to love the heavenly <hi>David</hi>-Saints; but, from that love, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come freely ſerviceable, with <hi>Jonathan,</hi> to place ſuch <hi>David</hi>'s on the Throne, in a ſtate, ſuperiour to themſelves; and that, as faithful in their ſervice to Chriſt, therein. Thus, through a union of love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Angels and heavenly Saints, are the Angels, under Chriſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to the bringing the whole Church of firſt-born <hi>David</hi>'s, into thoſe places in Chriſt's Kingdom, wherein to be, for ever, far ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to themſelves. And, till, ſeated there, do they exerciſe the utmoſt of their power, to protect the ſaid <hi>Davids</hi> from the malice of their invſible enemies, Devils, typed out by <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s faithful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming <hi>David</hi> of all <hi>Saul</hi>'s miſcheivous and malicious intendments, diſcovered towards him; and protecting him, from them. <hi>While theſe Princes</hi> or moſt heavenly Seed of Saints, <hi>are,</hi> in their unchanged bodies, <hi>walking on foot on the Earth</hi> (or, in the ſingle earthly ſpirit and mind) this foot or earthly principle is kept by them, from any ſuch wilful daſhing againſt (or ſtumbling at) the myſtical ſtone, Chriſt's new-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſpirit, as excludes from the true reſt, therein only attainable. In a like practice with <hi>Jonathan,</hi> in letter, they diſcover all the ſecret and ſubtile contrivances of myſtical <hi>Saul</hi>'s malice, againſt theſe ſpiritual <hi>Davids,</hi> that they may eſcape him. They thus protect them from the evil Angel; and, on the other hand, inform them of Chriſt's ſpiritual Kingdom, by communicating their viſions thereof. In both theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct works of love to Saints, will they appear more viſibly than ever, in their diſpenſation, immediately preparatory to Chriſt's ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And herein, as owned by Chriſt, ſo ought they, by Saints; <hi>Rev. 22. 16. I Jeſus have ſent mine Angel, to teſtify theſe things to the Churches;</hi> the things of the new-<hi>Jeruſalem</hi>-Kingdom of Chriſt, which will ſuddenly be made viſible; and, not only ſo, but <hi>to teſtify of me</hi> alſo, <hi>that I am the bright morning-Star,</hi> or, in my exalted humanity, head of theſe angelical Stars, in that reſurrection-glory, wherein they ſhall ſhine forth, in their preparatory morning-miniſtration, ſo as to be ſignally owned by me, in their faithful ſervice to me. This is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>(ver.</hi> 6.) <hi>Theſe ſayings are faithful and true. For, the Lord God of his holy Prophets hath ſent his Angel, to give them,</hi> the fore-running <hi>ſights of things,</hi> that as to publick and general manifeſtation, are <hi>yet to come;</hi> but, now at hand; and therefore, no longer to be ſealed up, but, open'd by Angels, to them, in Chriſt's preparatory day. And ſo alſo are the ſealed up judgments, by them, then to be opened, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34311:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> viſibly poured forth upon the enemies of his approach and Kingdom. This honour have the bleſſed Angels, even of being chief inſtruments in ſetting up the Kingdom of Chriſt, by communicating their ſights thereof, to Saints, belonging to the upper or lower new-<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or, ſpiritual Kingdom, in their diſtinct relations thereunto, as the heavenly, or, but earthly glorified ſeed. And, this ought, by them, both and all, to be thankfully acknowledged. <hi>When the Angel ſhew'd John the Lamb and his Bride, clothed with her wedding robe,</hi> her Huſband's hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſpirit, <hi>he fell at the Angel's feet, to worſhip him. But, the Angel ſaid, ſee thou do it not; for,</hi> though in this diſpenſation, I am above thee, yet <hi>am I but thy fellow-Servant,</hi> under our great Maſter, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to thee, who wilt, in concluſion, be exalted far above me. And then alſo, muſt we both, as <hi>holding of Jeſus, our head, in the true</hi> new-creation-<hi>ſpirit of prophecy, worſhip God alone.</hi> The heavenly ſeed of Saints, that receive the firſt revelations or viſions of the glory of Chriſt's Kingdom, from Angels, will be found to have an intereſt, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to theirs, therein, when they take their places about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Throne of Chriſt, ſet up in <hi>the third Heaven.</hi> Then will the Angels give up their guardianſhip over them, as no longer, needing it, being exalted above them. Yea, then will the Angels of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to receive inſtruction from them, to whom they, before, gave it. Then ſhall the marvellous and <hi>manifold wiſdom of God,</hi> appear, in cauſing <hi>the Church of his firſt-born-Saints,</hi> when exalted into their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places, to make a ſuitable return to the good Angels, for all their faithful ſervice of love to them, in communicating their higher viſions of God (in ſuch meaſure, as they are capable of receiving) than ever yet was attained by them. They will, under Chriſt, reveal to them that <hi>manifold-grace of God,</hi> that's the bleſſed portion of ſecond-reſurrection-Saints, received by them, immediately from Chriſt, and from him, by them, let down and revealed to Angels. Thus, makes he his bleſſed creatures, Angels and Saints, in the beauty and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his diſpenſations towards them, uſeful to one another; and, ſo to remain for ever, in their higher and lower places and offices, in Chriſt's body-myſtical, as is figuratively ſignified; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21. Many, who in their ſingle unchang'd humanity, Angels are the teachers of, will be in a ſuperiority to all Angels, and, in that ſence, ſaid <hi>to judg,</hi> even <hi>the</hi> holy <hi>Angels,</hi> as in a higher ſort of ſpiritual life and light, judgment, or diſcerning, then they; and ſo, fit inſtructers of them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:34311:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> God, to them, as Chriſt's higheſt and chief Miniſters. Theſe will make known to Chriſt's Angels and glorified earthly members <hi>the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of that myſtery,</hi> which, comparatively to the revelation, as yet, given thereof, hath bin, till then, <hi>hid in God.</hi> They ſhall fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the whole myſtery of divine and creature-fellowſhip in God the Mediatour, from everlaſting, to everlaſting; and ſo, <hi>the manifold</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and creature-<hi>wiſdom if God,</hi> to their inferiour-fellow-creaturs, which is, in the compleat fulneſs thereof, their continual viſion and food. But, though when the firſt-born heavenly Church take their ſeats in glory, Angels ceaſe from the exerciſe of rule over them, yet do they remain as door-keepers to the ſaid heavenly City and Society. They were placed from the beginning, as Chriſt's ſpiritual <hi>Watchmen, over this tree of Life</hi> or whole ſpiritual ſtate. And, in the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that office, have, ever ſince, with their <hi>flaming Swords</hi> or angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal weapons, bin made uſe of, by way of defence and ſervice to the ſaid ſtate, for directing the holy Seed to the right door of the bleſſed Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and, for the keeping any ſpiritually profane perſons, from entring thereat. They are ready, with their angelical flames, to deſtroy all ſuch. And when the good ſeed, even the firſt-born Church are all entred, and have taken their places, in a ſuperiority to them, will they, ſtill, for ever, hold the ſame place and ſtation, as door-keepers, in the neareſt relation to the ſaid firſt-born Church. To be ſuch <hi>a door-keeper</hi> to the ſecond-reſurrection-ſtate, <hi>David</hi> ſaw, was to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red above the higheſt glorified Saints, in the firſt, as neareſt to the heavenly Citizens, or firſt encompaſſers of the Throne. Alſo, under Chriſt and his heavenly Saints, are the holy Angels Princes or chief Rulers, in and over the firſt-reſurrection-ſtate, the outward row of encompaſſers; and therein, to remain for ever.</p>
            <p>And, as now we have ſeen the good Angels buſineſs, in the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory diſpenſation; we may obſerve the approbation, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from their great Lord and Maſter, for the ſame. As recompence of their labour of love to his Saints, <hi>will Chriſt,</hi> at end of their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory diſpenſation, <hi>ſay to them; well done, good and faithful Servants, enter into the full joy and enjoyment of your Lord, prepared for you,</hi> and reſerved to be given or conveighed to you, by the hand of my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Saints, at my command. Theſe higheſt inſtruments, under Chriſt, are to fill their angelical veſſels with that manifold grace and wiſdom of God, which till thus, by heavenly and moſt exalted Saints, could not, is not to be reveal'd to them, being of too vaſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34311:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> a nature, to be received by them, immediately, from Chriſt's own hand. Their portion therein, and viſions thereof, are appointed to be given forth to them, by his heavenly Church of firſt-born-Saints. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10. All others are too inferiour, and at too great a diſtance, to be immediate receivers thereof, from Chriſt, who, in all the diſtributions of the glory of this ſtate, is to be ſeen and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged head of this firſt-born-Church. And, in like manner, will the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſembly of earthly glorified Saints, acknowledg Chriſt, head of the angelical rulers over them, on the finiſhing their preparatory diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, for taking down the whole old, firſt-creation-World, and laying the foundation of the new. All this, by ſuch an opening of the ſealed up judgments of God, due to every part of this ſinful World (on the utmoſt trial, diſcover'd to be that accurſed Earth, which will not be made better) who ſhall, by the light of this ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical miniſtery, be diſcovered, and have a fire kindled in and upon them (as condemned perſons) that <hi>ſhall never be quench'd.</hi> They ſhall, in myſtical chains and fetters, put upon them, be ſecured and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, in order to their final ſentence, and execution thereof, from Chriſt's perſonal preſence. <hi>Then,</hi> as <hi>the King</hi> in the parable, <hi>will</hi> he <hi>ſay of the</hi> earthly-<hi>Jeruſalem-Citizens, as wilful refuſers of his raign over them, bring, and ſlay them before me;</hi> Luk. 19. 27. This ſhall be, when <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> the declared <hi>King of the whole World, ſhall ſit on the Throne of the Fathers glory, on Earth; Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. For this, <hi>will he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and aſſemble before him, all Nations,</hi> in order, <hi>to ſeparate</hi> his chaſt <hi>Sheep, from</hi> Satan's luſtful <hi>Goats</hi> (who through inordinate luſt after, and love to the fading life, wiſdom, power, and glory of their own old nature, have deſpiſed and rejected Chriſt's new-creature-nature, and life, wiſdom, righteouſneſs and power of God, therein) <hi>and will ſend both, to their</hi> reſpective <hi>places,</hi> or final ſtates of <hi>eternal life or death; Mat.</hi> 25. 31,-46. Then will incorrigibly wicked Angels and Men be chained up in unexpreſſible torment, ſo as in their height of rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, Chriſt, bleſſed Angels and Saints, not able to do any thing againſt them, to diſturbe their peaceable raign with Chriſt, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>his thouſand years</hi> viſible <hi>Kingdom, on Earth.</hi> And, <hi>to the Sheep on his right hand,</hi> the prepared ſpiritual members of his viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>will Chriſt ſay; come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, prepared for you, from the foundation of the World,</hi> either in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or natural, religious or civil capacity. This was declar'd to <hi>John;</hi> even, that <hi>all thoſe Souls,</hi> that had been, myſtically or literally,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34311:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>beheaded for the teſtimony of Jeſus, or word of God</hi> (who, by the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity of their ſpirit to Chriſt, have bin kept from <hi>worſhipping the Beaſt, his image, or receiving his mark in their foreheads,</hi> even an unchangeable enmity to God) <hi>ſhall,</hi> in one or other of the ſaid capacities, <hi>live and raign with Chriſt,</hi> in the firſt reſurrection-ſtate, whereby <hi>ſecured from</hi> any hurt by <hi>the ſecond death.</hi> The young and tender ſeed, alſo, to be awaken'd by the preparatory diſpenſation (that ſhall not, after that, in this powerful day of light, degenerate into ſtrange plants) ſhall, likewiſe, in their ſucceſſive generations, grow up, out of their reſtored principles of nature, into firſt or ſecond reſurrection-members of Chriſt's viſible ſpiritual Kingdom. This ſeaſon, to obedient Sheep, and luſtful, rebellious Goats, will be found the beſt and worſt of times. For, then will be made an abundant recompence, to Saints, for all the hard uſage <hi>for Chriſt's</hi> new <hi>name</hi> and life <hi>ſake,</hi> they have met with, from World and Devil. Then, ſhall they find the performance of all the <hi>great and glorious promiſes,</hi> ſo as to fill them with joy, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them bleſſed, beyond what the narrow natural heart of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Saint could imagine, conceive, deſire or wiſh. But, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to <hi>the inhabitants of the Earth, the Goats on the left hand,</hi> will this day of Chriſt, be the greateſt and ſaddeſt wo, imaginable. For, they will find the greateſt diſappointment, as to their miſ-grounded hopes of everlaſting happineſs, and true reſt; and in the room thereof, the height of a reſtleſs vexation of ſpirit, under a ſelf-condemning light, awaken'd up in them, in judgment, ſo as ever to ſee it brought upon them, by their own wilful folly. And, they will, alſo, ſee themſelves ſtripp'd of all means of coming out of the ſame, or of delivering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from, or, being reveng'd on, that power, againſt which they have rebelled, and, incorrigibly hardned themſelves. Yet, will they retain the utmoſt height of malice, for ever, <hi>to him that ſlays them,</hi> that divine and new-creature ſpirit, and life of Chriſt and God, <hi>which are</hi> unſpeakably <hi>above them. They will</hi> proudly and preſumptuouſly in their Luciferian ſpirit of unchangeable enmity, <hi>ſay, before him that ſlays them, I am God: but, ſhall be</hi> forced to ſee themſelves <hi>but Man, and not God, in the hand of him that ſlays them;</hi> Exek. 28. 9.</p>
            <p>And, thus have we, in ſome ſmall meaſure, obſerv'd the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt's viſible Kingdom, in the preparatory diſpenſation to it. In the beginning hereof, <hi>the two witneſſes are to be</hi> ſignally <hi>ſlain.</hi> Theſe are a twofold generation of ſpiritual Saints, that are to be his heavenly and earthly glorified congregation, or <hi>new</hi>-creation <hi>Heaven

The deſign of God, in ſuffering this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſuffering of his witneſſing Saints, (in ſuch a <hi>day of trouble</hi> to them, <hi>as never was, ſince there was a Nation)</hi> is, to introduce his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical preachers and witneſſing-riſen-Saints, whoſe joint-miniſtry will powerfully ſhake, and overturn all earthly buildings, foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or principles. The voice of God's providences, is ſuch, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords ſignificant ſigns, to the reading or underſtanding of rational men, of his preſent <hi>controverſy with the whole Earth.</hi> For, in a way of righteous judgment, is he confounding and overthrowing all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtitutions, religious and civil. The light of the day, ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly judges and diſcovers the rotten foundation, upon which, both are built, as undeniably to convince all, they can, no longer, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or uphold their own ſtructure. Yet, as the ſaddeſt lamentation, how little are theſe remarkable dealings of God, in order to theſe wonderful deſigns, taken notice of, not only, by the World, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but the profeſſing party, amongſt whom muſt be found, as to ſeed, the <hi>wiſe-Virgin</hi>-ſpirit? Even <hi>ſuch,</hi> alſo, <hi>are ſlumbring and ſleeping,</hi> in this dark day; and, in ſuch a remarkable calm of ſecurity, as is a moſt certain prefage of a ſtorm. And, if this be the temper of God's friends, a ſpiritual ſeed, what can be expected from incorrigible ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, on ſuch a wonderful commotion and ſhaking of their power, but a coming forth in their utmoſt ſtrength and higheſt expreſſions of rage and malice, to maintain themſelves againſt that power, the very light of the day convinces them, will undermine and deſtroy them, and all their worldly intereſts, literal and myſtical? But, to ſpiritual Saints, awaken'd and found alive, this diſpenſation (that is ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and confounding to others, as to <hi>make their Hearts fail for fear of what is coming upon the Earth)</hi> becomes a cheriſhing food, cauſing them <hi>to lift up their heads,</hi> though involv'd in God's outward chaſtiſement of the World, as having a common ſhare therein. They are ſupported and owned by God, as Friends, to whom he communicates the ſecret of his deſigns in all. He ſhews them, he is, therein, pleading their cauſe, in deſtroying his and their enemies, and ſecuring his beloved <hi>Lots,</hi> myſtically, and alſo litterally, ſo far as is for his glory, and their good. Though, therefore, the <hi>Figtree,</hi> their natural Spirit, <hi>bloſſom not, nor fruit be in the Vine,</hi> or true and choice
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34311:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> plants of the Kingdom; <hi>though the labour of the Olive fail, and there be no meat in the Field, no ſtock in the fold, or herd in the ſtalls,</hi> (Hab. 3. 17.) that is, though there be a myſtical as well as litteral Famine, by the total drying up of all Food to the natural mind, as well as body; yet, to the powerful faith of ſpiritual Saints, is it a time of rejoycing in their ſpiritual Lord, inviſibly communicating his <hi>hidden</hi> and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible <hi>Manna</hi> to them, which is <hi>a Bread of Life,</hi> not only to their ſpiritual, but natural Man, alſo, <hi>which lives not by that Bread</hi> which is the ſingle food of the natural Spirit, but ſuch as <hi>the living Word of God,</hi> is, and gives unto the whole Man of his Saints, for ever; <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 4. And then ſhall their natural man, as <hi>with Hinds feet, walk upon the high places of this</hi> firſt-creation-world, in a conquering and victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit, over them. Saints will find themſelves, more and more eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in their ſpiritual faith, and expectation of Chriſt's viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by thoſe very ways and means, concerning which the fleſhly mind or natural ſpirit, at beſt, as well as the profane world, do, with with the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Lord, judg, impoſſible to bring about ſuch a deſign. The true Believer, is ſo far from thinking God's arm ſhortned, or hand weakned, on this withdrawing all ſort of viſible help from them, as thereby to be quickned up, into the expectation of thoſe angelical powers, Chriſt hath in reſerve, to work their deliverance, by. Nothing, to them, ſeems lacking, but ſuch a powerful exerciſe of their precious faith, as may give them a patient waiting upon God, for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (and that, with great advantage) of whatever he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as to the actual ſetting up of Chriſt's kingdom, and rule of love over them. <hi>Then will our</hi> bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> ariſe, <hi>out of his</hi> holy, new-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-<hi>Temple,</hi> and in his ſpiritual glory or ſecond appearance, take a viſible poſſeſſion of that univerſal power and authority, which was always his right, from the foundation of the World. <hi>He will bow,</hi> and open <hi>thoſe Heavens, in which, all this while, retained; Act.</hi> 3. 21. He will deſcend, and actually let down that <hi>new-Jeruſalem</hi>-glory, <hi>out of</hi> the ſaid <hi>Heaven,</hi> which is the proper clothing, provided by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for his heavenly and earthly-glorified Saints. For, when the preparatory work is compleated, the King himſelf, will ſuddenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. <hi>Even ſo, come Lord Jeſus, and all thy Saints with thee; come quickly. Amen.</hi>
